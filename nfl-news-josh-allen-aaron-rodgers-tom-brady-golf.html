<time>04 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The trash-talking has already begun between Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady and Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes ahead of their upcoming golf faceoff. The game has been dubbed ‘The Match’ and is essentially a battle between two generations. The game aims to raise money for charities and settle some competitive scores as well. All the players involved have some amount of experience playing golf, Brady has played in multiple celebrity tournaments, and he played against Rodgers last year. Rodgers is also equally experienced in playing golf. Mahomes teamed up with Kelce and won Justin Timberlake’s “8AM Golf Invitational.” so he is no bum either.</p><p>Both the teams have already begun trash-talking one another as per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Greg Auman</a> of The Athletic,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Aaron Rodgers</a> believes that he and Brady will be able to easily get into their opponents’ heads. “We’re from the older era. When I started playing, there was actual trash talk, guys trash-talking each other. There was a lot of good shit-talking. You knew who they were around the league.” Rodgers said describing his era when he entered the NFL, he believes that today’s players want to be friends with everyone and are diplomatic.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>Also read: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“It makes me fearful to have children”: Dak Prescott and his teammates are speechless and shocked following the shooting in Texas</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>“It’s not the same”: Rodgers believes the league was much better with trash talking</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-12-2-1024x576.jpg><p>Rodgers went on to say, “Now it’s more buddy-buddy, social media, following each other, memes, all this emoji shit. It’s not the same. When you talk about Kermit the Frog (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Mahomes</a>) and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> (Allen</a>) trying to shit-talk me and Tom, a couple of old-school grizzled vets… come on. They better have some prepared material that’s written by Bill Burr and Brian Regan or some shit. They’re not going to be able to hang with Tommy and I.” The Green Bay quarterback roasted the younger QBs and thinks that he and Tom will walk all over them.</p><p>He does not even think that they have what it takes to roast them back, and even if they do, they’ll need a good ghostwriter to write down some lines for them. Josh Allen proved Aaron wrong almost immediately, he blasted Tom Brady and showed us a side of him that we never could have anticipated from him.</p><p>“Once Tom’s script from his team runs out of jokes, I don’t think he’s going to be able to really think on his feet like that, I’ve got a lot of practice in wit and off-the-cuff stuff. I think Aaron’s a little better in that aspect. Tom’s going to have his little note card out there and he’s going to run out eventually. I don’t think he’s going to know what to do.” Josh Allen cleverly gave his flowers to his opponent while also destroying <a href=#>Brady.</a> He took shots at his diplomatic attitude and his tendency to give predictable replies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Adobe_Express_20220529_2331420-1024x576.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TB12</a> was clearly not going to sit and take that from a quarterback who hasn’t even made a Super Bowl. This gave us a preview of what we can expect in the next week’s matchup. “I can neither confirm nor deny anything along those lines, I will come prepared like I always do to everything. Golf shit-talk is a little different than pro football shit-talk. Usually pro football shit-talk, you have to back that up. Josh Areally hasn’t backed much up on the football field in his career, let’s be honest, especially playing against me… Patrick, although he’s played a lot of great games, he didn’t really win the important ones. He’s won a few of the other ones, but not really important ones… I’ve been doing this too long. Too damn long,” we all knew Brady was going to flex his career achievements over his opponents and he does have the right to do so as what he has achieved is nothing easy.</p><p>Nevertheless, it will be exciting to hear the actual trash talk during the game next week. The preview is already very interesting and has us excited.</p><p><strong>Also read:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Just wanted to send some love to people of Buffalo” – Mike Myers wears Sabres jersey on ‘The Late Show’</a></strong></strong></p><p><strong>Also read:&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>“Jon Jones and Israel Adesanya have to be around each other”- Brendan Schaub proposes an interesting idea for UFC 276</a></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZ%2BjZqaVrMButs6sn2aZnKGyr3nAmqmopl2nvKWzxKuqZqyfonqjvsCdsGafn6GzcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnfl-news-josh-allen-aaron-rodgers-tom-brady-golf.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnfl-news-josh-allen-aaron-rodgers-tom-brady-golf.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnfl-news-josh-allen-aaron-rodgers-tom-brady-golf.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnfl-news-josh-allen-aaron-rodgers-tom-brady-golf.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnfl-news-josh-allen-aaron-rodgers-tom-brady-golf.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnfl-news-josh-allen-aaron-rodgers-tom-brady-golf.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ho-oh-weakness-counters-best-moveset-shiny-raid.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ho-oh-weakness-counters-best-moveset-shiny-raid.html>Pokmon Go Ho-oh best movesets, weakness, counters, and raid guide</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./keisha-grant.html>Keisha Grant Nbc, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Spouse, Wedding, Salary, and net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./keisha-grant.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
