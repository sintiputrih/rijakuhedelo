Banks stands at a height of 1.65 m tall and weighs 52kg.</p><p>Her family relocated to several locations, including Minnesota, in order to find Joshua, her autistic brother, medical facilities and schools.</p><p>She started her professional wrestling career there when they settled there. She attended online classes and was a lifelong fan of All Japan Women’s Pro-Wrestling (AJW).</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><a href=#>READ ALSO: Sasha Banks Children: Does Sasha Banks Have Kids?</a></h4><p>In 2008, Banks started his training at the Woburn, Massachusetts-based Chaotic Wrestling (CW). On October 1, 2010, she entered the ring for the first time as Mercedes KV. In an intergender tag team match against Alexxis and Danny E, she teamed up with Nikki Roxx. Banks and Roxx rapidly established a partnership, working together frequently and going to ringside together.</p><p>Banks won her first bout on January 7, 2011, when she and Roxx triumphed against Alexxis and Mistress Belmont in a tag team contest. On February 11, Banks attempted to become the first Chaotic Wrestling Women’s Champion by competing in a five-woman gauntlet match, but she was unsuccessful.</p><p>Barbie was the opponent for KV’s first successful title defense on January 6, 2012. On January 27, Banks met Luscious Latasha with the championship on the line, and Banks won. In a rematch, Banks triumphantly defended the title over Alexxis.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The championship was then twice successfully defended by her against Nikki Roxx. After retaining the title on June 1 against Alexxis, Barbie, and Mistress Belmont in a fatal four-way match, Banks broke Alexxis’s previous record of 182 days to become the longest-reigning Chaotic Wrestling Women’s Champion in history.</p><p>Banks made her professional wrestling debut in New England Championship Wrestling (NECW) on August 8 when she teamed up with Ivy to defeat Sammi Lane and Ariel’s team.</p><p>Banks attended a WWE tryout camp in June 2012, and on August 18 it was revealed that she had been offered a contract. She was given the ring name Sasha Banks and moved to WWE’s developmental division, NXT, where she made her televised debut on NXT on December 12 and lost to Paige.</p><p>On the January 23, 2013 broadcast of NXT, Banks defeated Alicia Fox to get her first win on television. Following this, Banks entered a plot in which she began receiving letters from a mysterious admirer. It was later discovered that this person was Audrey Marie, who later returned to assault Banks on the NXT show airing on February 20 out of retaliation for Banks’ success.</p><p>The NXT Women’s Champion Paige defeated Banks after weeks of Summer Rae’s influence, and although Paige tried to console her, Banks assaulted her, turning her into a villain. This all happened on the September 11 episode of NXT.</p><p>Banks was defeated by Bayley in a contest to decide the top challenger for the NXT Women’s Championship on the August 14 episode of NXT. After Bayley’s title match with Charlotte at NXT TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way on September 11, Banks attacked her before Charlotte stopped her.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Banks lost the NXT Women’s Championship to Bayley at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn on August 22, ending her 192-day reign.</p><p>Following Stephanie McMahon’s demand for a “revolution” in the WWE Divas division, Banks made her formal debut on the July 13, 2015, episode of Raw with Charlotte and Becky Lynch.</p><p>During a month off the air, Banks made her television debut again on January 24, 2016, at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, when she attacked Charlotte and Becky Lynch following their championship bout to signal her desire to win the Divas Championship.</p><p>After a break, Banks returned to WWE television in early June, and after an attack alongside Paige on the June 20 episode of Raw, she later resumed her feud with Charlotte over the WWE Women’s Championship.</p><p>Banks, Bayley, and Mickie James began a feud with the newly-debuting faction Absolution (Paige, Mandy Rose, and Sonya Deville) at&nbsp;the close of 2017, as they were repeatedly attacked on several occasions. This resulted in numerous singles and tag team contests, most of which were won by Absolution.</p><p>Following weeks of tension between the two, including Bayley abandoning Banks during their matches, they got into a fight backstage and had to be removed on the March 26 episode of Raw.</p><p>The following day, Banks abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance on Wendy, a morning talk show. The following week, rumors from dirt sheets spread that she was considering leaving the company because of her long-standing grievances with WWE.</p><p>Following WrestleMania 36, Banks and Bayley teased the possibility of a rivalry, with the emphasis on the narrative that Banks is the cause of Bayley’s success and that Bayley is mostly to blame for Banks’ losing endeavors.</p><p>Banks and Asuka competed for the Raw Women’s Championship on July 19 at The Horror Show at Extreme Rules. The contest was marred by controversy after Asuka unintentionally spit green mist in the referee’s face. Once the referee’s shirt was gone, Bayley counted the pin to declare Banks the undisputed champion.</p><p>Banks suffered a calcaneus injury on January 2, 2022, while competing against Charlotte Flair in a house show match. On the SmackDown broadcast from January 28 she would return, where she declared for the Royal Rumble match.</p><p>Varnado, now known by the ring name Mercedes Moné, debuted for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) on January 4, 2023, at Wrestle Kingdom 17, when she faced Kairi, the IWGP Women’s Champion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Sasha Banks’ parents?</h2><p>Banks was born to Reo Varnado and Judith Varnado. Her mother is of German descent, while her father was African-American.</p><p>Rapper Snoop Dogg, who assisted Kaestner-Varnado in creating her in-ring persona, is a first cousin through her father. She is also related to artists Brandy Norwood and Ray J as well as music producer Daz Dillinger.</p><p>Source:<a href=# rel=noopener> www.Ghgossip.com</a></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqyYrKCRYq%2BiusqsZKmZopq7tb%2BMppyerF2nsrB5wKebZqKlmba1tIyvmKumkZm8cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsasha-banks-parents-meet-reo-and-judith-varnado.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsasha-banks-parents-meet-reo-and-judith-varnado.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsasha-banks-parents-meet-reo-and-judith-varnado.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsasha-banks-parents-meet-reo-and-judith-varnado.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsasha-banks-parents-meet-reo-and-judith-varnado.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsasha-banks-parents-meet-reo-and-judith-varnado.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sex-diaries.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sex-diaries.html>Sex Diaries - Vulture</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./local-business-in-brief-42.html>LOCAL BUSINESS / IN BRIEF | News, Sports, Jobs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./local-business-in-brief-42.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
