Isidor and Bernadette Jansen have three boys, with him being the youngest. When&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>was 12 years old, his father, who had worked in construction, suffered a stroke. His mother works as a travel agent.</p><p>Because TBS in Curaçao carried the team’s games,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>grew up a Braves fan. Later, the squad also signed Jansen’s older brother Ardley and fellow Curaçaoan Andruw Jones.</p><p>At age six,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kenley Jansen</a>&nbsp;started playing baseball with his brothers. He started out playing outfield before switching to shortstop. After that,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>was moved to third base and introduced to Andrelton Simmons. Later, he caught and played first base.</p><p>On November 17, 2004, the Dodgers organization signed catcher&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>as an undrafted free agent. He was given the opportunity to play for the Rookie Class Gulf Coast Dodgers, where he played in 37 games and hit.304. On August 26, he was given the opportunity to join the Ogden Raptors of the Pioneer League.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><a href=#>READ ALSO: Kenley Jansen Parents: Meet Bernadette And Isidor Jansen</a></h4><p>In 73 games in 2007,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>played for both the Raptors and the Class-A Great Lakes Loons of the Midwest League. He hit.207. He participated in Hawaii Winter Baseball once more after the season, this time for the West Oahu C aneFires.</p><p>He served as the Netherlands team’s starting catcher at the 2009 World Baseball Classic. A crucial play in the game occurred in the ninth inning when&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>threw out Willy Taveras on an attempted steal of third base, allowing the Netherlands to defeat the Dominican Republic squad that was expected to win.</p><p><a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>was promoted to the Dodgers on July 23, 2010. On July 24 against the New York Mets, he made his Major League debut in relief, pitching a scoreless inning by retiring all three batters he faced and striking out two.</p><p><a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>rose to prominence in the Dodgers’ bullpen in 2011. In 53+2/3 innings, he was 2-1 with a 2.85 ERA and five saves. With 16+13 strikeouts per nine innings,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen</a> also set a new Major League season record by striking out 96 batters.</p><p>After Javy Guerra struggled in the position,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>was named the Dodgers’ closer in May 2012. After missing a few games due to heart issues,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>was replaced as a closer by Brandon League at the end of the season.</p><p>By agreeing to a $4.3 million contract with the Dodgers on February 11, 2014,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>was able to bypass his first arbitration hearing. 2014 saw&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>solidify his role as the Dodgers’ closer, pitching in 68 games with a 2.76 ERA, 101 strikeouts, and 44 saves.</p><p>He avoided arbitration once more on January 16, 2015, when he agreed to a one-year, $7.425 million deal with the Dodgers. He had surgery to remove a growth from a bone in his left foot, though, on February 17.</p><p>With his 162nd career save against the Washington Nationals on June 20, 2016,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>broke Éric Gagné’s all-time team record. His first all-star selection was to the National League squad for the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.</p><p>At Coors Field in Denver on April 7, 2019,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>made a four-out save against the Colorado Rockies.</p><p>By retiring Austin Nola of the San Diego Padres on August 25,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>became the twelfth reliever in MLB history to reach 1,000 strikeouts. With 38 saves, a 2.22 ERA, and 86 strikeouts in 69 innings, Jansen ended the 2021 campaign. On March 18, 2022, <a href=#>Jansen </a>agreed to a $16 million one-year deal with the Atlanta Braves.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kenley Jansen wife: Meet Gianni Jansen</h2><p><a href=#>Jansen </a>is married to a Curaçao native named&nbsp;Gianni Jansen-Fransisca.
