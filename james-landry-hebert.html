The Actor was Born in Lafayette and not New Orleans as Widely Believed</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Numerous sources have given New Orleans, Louisiana as the actor’s birthplace.

James Landry Hébert Was Orphaned at a Very Young Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jamie lost both his parents when he was only a child. The account of their deaths is elusive to the media. Following this, he lived with his aunt for some years before he was adopted by a Chitimacha couple, Ted and Rhonda Darden who were on an Indian reservation program.</p><p>The Chitimacha couple got him enrolled in a tribal school in Chitimacha which made him the first non-native student in the school. James was able to relate to their culture and also developed the art of storytelling. Later, he earned his college degree in theater at Louisiana State University.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3_His_Passion_For_Acting_Was_Ignited_at_a_Very_Age></span><strong>3.

After this, he was offered a day job to work alongside one of the best casting directors in Louisiana, Elizabeth Coulon.</p><p>Interestingly, Elizabeth made him her casting assistant for over three years, and later her casting associate.

As a way of portraying a better picture of this ancient and traditional art, James formed an original storytelling platform in collaboration with Hollywood filmmakers.</p><p>The platform was designed to give life to storytelling and teach native youths how to use the secret tool. James revealed that he would be honored to have the story of his life and adoption by locals being watched as a movie someday. Additionally, the program aims at preserving the culture of the village that raised him as a dynamic storyteller.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=7_He_Had_a_Committed_Longterm_Relationship_but_is_not_Married></span><strong>7.
