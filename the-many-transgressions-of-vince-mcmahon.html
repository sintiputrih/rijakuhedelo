They lived fairly close to each other, did some business together, and had a mutual respect. My dad was also something of a wrestling fan, so it was a cool friendship that he speaks fondly of today.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>With the ongoing controversies surrounding the now-former CEO of the WWE, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vince McMahon</a></strong>, I decided to write this article about him. The most recent controversy, as reported by the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, involves McMahon allegedly participating in a form of sex trafficking.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>When I told my dad who I was writing about, he mentioned that Lou Albano once said to him that Vince McMahon’s father was a great man but that Vince himself was crazy. Albano said it’s partly why he originally retired in 1986 despite having just managed the British Bulldogs to the title. He thought Vince was untrustworthy.</p><p data-characters=31 data-current-count=31 data-injectable=false>It turns out that he was right.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Since then, Vince McMahon has been involved in numerous cover-ups and controversies, most of it in the name of greed. He has made the WWE the biggest wrestling organization in the world but it has come at a tremendous cost to others. Perhaps now, if justice still breathes, it will come at a cost to himself.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>Vince bought the WWE from his father in 1982 and the troubles began almost right away. Here’s a list of just some of those troubles, concluding with details of the new allegations against him.</p><h2 id=h-death-of-nancy-argentino data-injectable=false>Death of Nancy Argentino</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>In May 1983, Nancy Argentino, girlfriend of WWE superstar Jimmy “Superfly” Snuka, died of traumatic brain injuries. Her body had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">significant signs of physical abuse</a> and it was recommended by the pathologist who performed the autopsy that it be investigated as a homicide. The coroner agreed.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>Snuka, and only Snuka, had been with her and claimed that she fell. His story later changed. He also had been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested a few months earlier</a> for assault because two police deputies, who arrived on the scene of a call of domestic violence, witnessed Snuka “forcibly dragging the naked Ms. Argentino down the hallway by her hair as she was draped in a blanket.” Snuka pled guilty and was fined.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>According to police records, one month after Argentino’s death, Vince McMahon and Jimmy Snuka had a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">meeting with the Assistant District Attorney</a> and three detectives. There is no information, however, on what was said at the meeting. In his 2012 book, Jimmy Snuka states about the meeting, “All I remember is Vince had a briefcase with him. I don’t know what happened.”</p><p data-characters=25 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>Charges were not pressed.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>Snuka continued his career and had what is now a famous steel cage match in Madison Square Garden just a few months later. He was a hot commodity. He made Vince money. He was even a part of the main event at the first-ever Wrestlemania in 1985.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Over three decades later, Snuka was charged with the third-degree murder of Argentino. However, in January 2017, he was deemed not mentally fit to stand trial and died two weeks later, at age 73, after a battle with stomach cancer.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The abuse allegations against the Fabulous Moolah</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>The Fabulous Moolah was the Women’s Wrestling Champion for 28 years. She also trained female wrestlers independently but also reportedly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">abused many of them</a> and she would even leave them with powerful men in the business, some of whom would allegedly abuse them further.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>She managed to also take advantage of those whom she sent to Vince to wrestle by making sure that her wrestlers only received payments through her, taking as much as 50% before paying them. This was made possible because Vince made certain to always pay Moolah for the matches that her wrestlers were involved in, regardless if Moolah was wrestling or not.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>In the years following Moolah’s death, many have been coming forward to share their story of abuse, forcing the WWE to change certain honors they gave Moolah and bringing the organization itself — as well as Vince McMahon — into question for enabling her for decades.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sexual molestation allegations against employees</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=583 data-current-count=883 data-injectable=true>In 1992, wrestler Terry Garvin and former wrestler Pat Patterson were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of sexual abuse</a>. Many witnesses have come forward and said that they were fired shortly after they refused the sexual advances of Garvin or Patterson. However, it gets worse. Garvin had allegedly made sexual advances to ring boys and Vince McMahon seemed intent on defending Garvin and Patterson. He had reason to. After all, Patterson was a major contributor to the company’s success. He was the first-ever Intercontinental Champion and the hugely successful annual Royal Rumble was Patterson’s idea.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Yet, it gets even worse. Ring announcer Mel Phillips was also in charge of overseeing the ring boys, who were mostly just local kids who would volunteer for what was a single event after Phillips would entice them with the opportunity to see wrestling for free. During his career, he was accused of molesting countless kids.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>The Phillips scandal caused Linda McMahon, Vince’s wife, to fire Phillips in 1988 but she eventually re-hired him on the premise that he stop chasing kids, as revealed and reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider.</a></p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>Then the public scandal about sexual molestation within the WWE broke in 1992, putting Garvin, Patterson, and Phillips back in the spotlight. Vince reacted by releasing all three before he showed up for a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one-hour interview with Phil Donahue</a> who brought along multiple former WWE employees who were let go after telling Vince that Garvin and/or Patterson made sexual advances toward them.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=751 data-injectable=true>McMahon denied knowledge of any wrongdoing, claimed the employees were fired because they were incompetent, and defended himself and his company vigorously, as one would expect from him to do. However, even the wrestlers that McMahon trusted, like Bruno Sammartino and Superstar Billy Graham, had something to say to him about his poor handling of the situation.</p><p data-characters=60 data-current-count=60 data-injectable=false>After the public scandal calmed, McMahon re-hired Patterson.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>The Mel Phillips scandal resurfaced in 2021 when it was reported in detail that one of the kids who Phillips molested was Tom Cole. Shortly after the story was made popular again, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cole committed suicide</a> and his brother took to Twitter to blame the McMahons for covering up for child molesters.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>My brother Tom Committed suicide a couple of hours ago. Vince Mc Mahon and his wife Linda let child molesters into their companies years ago and did everything possible to cover up what they did to my brother. I hope you can sleep good at night Vince. Our family suffers.

Vince even admitted he bought some from Zahorian.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>In 1994, <a href=#>Vince was now the one on trial </a>and many WWE stars testified during the trial, including Hulk Hogan who admitted using steroids and getting them at WWE events and even, at times, at the WWE headquarters in Connecticut. Though Hogan claimed McMahon was not involved, at least one wrestler said that not only was McMahon involved but he pressured him to take steroids.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>Facing a million-dollar fine and over a decade in prison, Vince McMahon was acquitted of the charges and escaped it all.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Allegations of hush money payouts and admission of affairs</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>In July of 2022, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> reported that Vince McMahon paid four different women, all former employees, hush money over allegations of sexual misconduct. For 16 years, the Journal claims, Vince paid out at least $12 million. The report pushed him out of the door of the WWE.</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>Two more women have come forth since and made similar claims.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>It’s worth noting that back in 2002, during a Playboy Magazine interview, Vince McMahon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to numerous affairs</a>. When asked if he has always been faithful to his wife, McMahon responded, “Not necessarily,” yet claimed he was always loyal to her.</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=97 data-injectable=false>He then stated, “I probably lied to myself, thinking she knew who I was when we got married.”</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Later in the interview, he explained that his wife confronted him and finally asked him directly if he was having an affair, to which Vince responded yes and said, “It crushed her. Then she asked, ‘What about such and such?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ It went on. More names. I said, ‘yes and yes.’”</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>In explaining his actions he told Playboy, “It’s not something I’m proud of. I just didn’t realize the impact of messing with other people’s lives. I hurt a lot of people. The sex was terrific but from an emotional standpoint, I regret it.”</p><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>I’m sure that Vince adding that the “sex was terrific” made his wife feel even more special.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sex trafficking allegations</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>THREAD 1/2 (TW):</p><p>Screenshots of Vince McMahon’s messages from the new sex trafficking lawsuit: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pqx78GHSwU</a></p>— Wrestle Ops (@WrestleOps) <a href=#>January 25, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>In Jan. 2024, former WWE employee — Janel Grant — filed a complaint in Connecticut federal court alleging that she was trafficked to WWE executives by Vince McMahon, as reported by the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>Text messages were revealed that appear to show McMahon texting Grant in obscene detail. After texting her in May of 2020 that he “controls” her, McMahon allegedly forced himself on her, including one incident at the WWE headquarters, after which McMahon sent her $15,000 in gift cards later that same day.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>McMahon is also accused of sharing nude photos of her and sexual videos of her with some of his employees. In an apparent attempt to re-sign former WWE champion Brock Lesnar, McMahon ordered Grant to send him sexualized photos and videos. Lesnar allegedly asked her to send him videos of her urinating. McMahon was able to convince Lesnar to temporarily rejoin the WWE.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=800 data-injectable=true>The lawsuit also claims that McMahon wanted her to have sex with others and that this desire of his was ultimately fulfilled by other WWE executives, including — as the lawsuit alleges — former WWE head of talent relations, John Laurinaitis. McMahon would order Grant to visit Laurenaitis in hotel rooms, she claims. On at least one occasion, they would take turns holding her down while the other would rape her, states Grant.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>The sexually themed text messages are disturbing. In them, if they are proven to be sent by Vince McMahon, the former WWE boss describes what he wants Grant to do. The lawsuit claims that the acts he describes did happen.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>Additionally, McMahon named sex toys after other wrestlers and used them on her, she alleges. Grant also claims that during a forcible threesome in 2020 McMahon defecated on her head.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>Grant alleges that McMahon used his authoritative power over her to weaken her and to control her. Ultimately, she left the WWE and claims that McMahon paid her a million dollars to keep quiet.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Needless to say, Vince McMahon will likely never honestly be admired for who he is as a man. It’s doubtful that he will be admired at all. At one time, people did admire him for his success but how he achieved such success is greatly in question and, furthermore, what he allegedly did with that success is truly abhorrent.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>He has been involved in many other controversies — too many to name here — but the ones listed above are the ones that define him. At least, the ones we know about.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBqbGMppinsV2pv6K60qCpnqujnryvv4yonWaumaOwpnnMnKSaoJ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-many-transgressions-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-many-transgressions-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-many-transgressions-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-many-transgressions-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-many-transgressions-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-many-transgressions-of-vince-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amber-heard-gets-to-work-filming-new-thriller-in-the-fire-in-guatemala-city.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amber-heard-gets-to-work-filming-new-thriller-in-the-fire-in-guatemala-city.html>Amber Heard Gets to Work Filming New Thriller In The Fire in Guatemala City</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./theater-review-little-prince-broadway-nyc-html.html>The Little Prince Crash-lands on This Planet</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./theater-review-little-prince-broadway-nyc-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
