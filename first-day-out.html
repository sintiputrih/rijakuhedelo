This portrays his unconventional lifestyle as he prepares for work. The use of baking soda, pot, and a silver fork implies that he is ready to get into the kitchen to cook up some illicit drugs to sell for cash. His affiliation with illegal activities is further revealed as he mentions he works with “chicken”. This is street slang for drugs, particularly cocaine. Gucci uses a play on words by referring to his room full of drugs and money as the “chicken room” and “basement full of Benjamins”. He goes on to explain that he has a variety of weapons to protect himself, highlighting the dangerous nature of his lifestyle.</p><br><p>Gucci Mane describes his motivation for his illegal activities being to provide for his family as well as his lavish lifestyle. His “baby needs some shoes, aunty needs a purse” and he needs a convertible for summer. Throughout the song, he hints at his wealth by referencing his expensive jewelry and vehicles. His wealth and defiant attitude are further demonstrated by his line “Did you miss me or miss my raps, bitch?” referring to his time spent in jail prior to the release of the song. Overall, the lyrics of “First Day Out” paint a vivid picture of a lifestyle entrenched in illegal activity and the societal pressures which influence it.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline
