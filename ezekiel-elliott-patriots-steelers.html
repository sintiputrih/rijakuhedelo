A brief stint with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=unROptTvWAZr04Fe href=#>James Robinson</a> didn‚Äôt go as planned. Ty Montgomery was often injured and more of a receiving threat.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>So Belichick decided the Pats needed more help behind Stevenson. Just three weeks before the season started, he signed <a class=ath_autolink data-id=whn8tlH32SbWznBB href=#>Ezekiel Elliott</a> to a one-year deal worth $3 million. Three months later, that‚Äôs been one of <a href=#>Belichick‚Äôs</a> best moves of the year.</p><p>Not much has gone as planned for the Patriots in 2023. The draft class has been underwhelming, stunted by injuries and a lack of opportunity. The free-agent fixes on the offensive line have not worked out. The offense as a whole, where many expected a vast improvement with the addition of Bill O‚ÄôBrien, has been hugely disappointing.</p><p>But Elliott has been vital. The veteran back stepped in for Stevenson on Thursday and was the main reason the offense moved the ball effectively in a <a href=# rel=noopener>21-18 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. Elliott accounted for 140 of the Patriots‚Äô 303 total yards.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Patriots defense delivers vintage performance in shocking 'TNF' win over Steelers</p></a><p>With Stevenson potentially out for the rest of the season, Elliott will remain the team‚Äôs top running back. And if he plays the final four games like he did in Pittsburgh, Elliott could set himself up for another contract with the Patriots, potentially sticking around next season and beyond, too.</p><p>‚ÄúI definitely love playing with Rhamondre,‚Äù Elliott said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotten super close since we‚Äôve been here. It sucks that he wasn‚Äôt out there with us. But it definitely feels good for me to get out there, get the touches, touch the ball a lot, get in a rhythm and be a big part of this win.‚Äù</p><p lang=nl dir=ltr>Zappe ‚û°Ô∏è Zeke! <a href=#>@baileyzappe04</a> | <a href=#>@EzekielElliott</a></p><p>üì∫: <a href=#>#NEvsPIT</a> on <a href=#>@NFLonPrime</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MB9eFOQWwj</a></p><p>‚Äî New England Patriots (@Patriots) <a href=#>December 8, 2023</a></p><p>It‚Äôs bleak to think about what the Patriots offense would look like at this stage of the season without Elliott. The passing game has improved slightly since quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=18zaLFAmDNfVSyfc href=#>Mac Jones</a> was benched for <a class=ath_autolink data-id=XPOo7908g58gRNmJ href=#>Bailey Zappe</a>. But even in the best game of Zappe‚Äôs career, the unit still slumped in the second half against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=55 href=#>Steelers</a>, managing only 44 passing yards in the final 30 minutes. And 72 of Zappe‚Äôs 240 passing yards came on throws to Elliott. Without him, the Pats would likely have Montgomery or Harris as their feature back right now.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>He was critical, too, in icing the team‚Äôs win Thursday night. The 28-year-old Elliott touched the ball on 15 of the Patriots‚Äô 22 second-half plays.</p><p>‚ÄúTo be able to do what Zeke did as far as the run game and pass game, it just shows that he‚Äôs still the old-time Zeke and he still has a lot left in the tank,‚Äù Zappe said.</p><p>The Patriots had more success passing the ball downfield against the Steelers than in other games. On his second throw, Zappe hit <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ywZaiAVoxbDIL63z href=#>JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> for a 37-yard gain. He also connected with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=faCRs4xBadyO9usw href=#>Hunter Henry</a> on a 24-yard touchdown. Both passes were impressive.</p><p>But it‚Äôs also true the New England offense will still largely be based on the running game and short passes. That will especially be the case against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=46 href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> on Sunday if the Patriots want to control the clock and keep the ball out of Patrick Mahomes‚Äô hands. That means another busy day for Elliott.</p><p>In years past, the veteran running back has slowed down as the seasons near their end. Last season with the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=39 href=#>Dallas Cowboys</a>, his yards per carry dipped to 2.7 in the final four games after running for 4.2 yards per carry over the first 11 games. But after occupying the No. 2 role behind Stevenson for most of this season, Elliott feels he‚Äôs ready to end this Patriots season with a bang.</p><p>‚ÄúThis is the best I‚Äôve felt this late in the season,‚Äù he said.</p><p>Belichick isn‚Äôt one to frequently hand out praise. But he does typically compile a video of some of the team‚Äôs best hustle plays and hard work to show players as a reward. None of Elliott‚Äôs 29 touches from Thursday are likely to end up on that reel.</p><p>But Elliott made a game-saving play without the ball in his hands. When Zappe threw an interception late in the third quarter, it seemed destined to head back to the end zone for a pick six. Instead, Elliott ran across half the field to make a touchdown-saving tackle. The Patriots defense, which has been stout over the last month, then forced a turnover on downs that kept the Steelers from scoring even though they started the drive on the New England 16-yard line after the interception. In a 3-point win, that was a massive turn of events.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tipped and picked! <a href=#>@Steelers</a> take over in their own territory<a href=#>#NEvsPIT</a> on Prime Video<br>Also available on <a href=#>#NFLPlus</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/0GJemAElFj</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZOvaNHrZfm</a></p><p>‚Äî NFL (@NFL) <a href=#>December 8, 2023</a></p><p>‚ÄúI thought Zeke ran hard and he made a big play on the interception, kept them out of the end zone, and then we ended up getting a defensive stop on that,‚Äù Belichick said. ‚ÄúThat was a huge play.‚Äù</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>In a season with a lot of lows, a backup running back playing well isn‚Äôt exactly headline news.
