This installment in the sports docuseries takes a compelling turn as it explores the remarkable real-life story of Hollywood actors <a href=#><strong>Rob McElhenney</strong> and </a><strong><a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a> </strong>stepping into the world of sports ownership. When they first made the audacious decision to acquire the title of the world's third-oldest professional soccer club, their move was met with widespread confusion and even ridicule in the media. Yet, despite their admitted lack of football expertise, McElhenney and Reynolds seem unwavering in their commitment to rekindle the team's glory and bring pride to the town, which has seen its beloved club languishing outside the English Football League for too long. Having received six Emmy Award nominations, including for Outstanding Unstructured Reality Series, Welcome to Wrexham is an up-close-and-personal look into this transformative journey that promises to be a testament to their dedication and determination. With that said, here are all the details revealed so far about Welcome to Wrexham Season 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Editor's Note: This article was updated on September 11.</p><h2 id=when-is-39-welcome-to-wrexham-39-season-2-coming-out>When Is 'Welcome to Wrexham' Season 2 Coming Out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/welcome-to-wrexham-ryan-reynolds-social-featured.jpg><p>FX's acclaimed documentary series Welcome to Wrexham is set to make a dazzling return as it kicks off its second season on <a href=#>Tuesday, September 12, 2023</a>, creating excitement on the field once again.

With their status, it's no secret that their star power helped elevate the team's reputation both locally and internationally. With a strong fan base under their wing, things are looking up for the Wrexham Football Club. But behind every success comes a cost. As the trailer suggests, all this increased investment into the club, although helpful, will become unsustainable unless they achieve their primary goal of promotion into the English Football League system. If achieved, they might just stand a chance to heighten their revenue streams, all while underscoring high stakes and ambitions. We also got a <a href=#>new teaser for Welcome to Wrexham Season 2</a> recently, which shows the movie star club owners preparing for a royal visit by the recently-anointed King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, <strong>Charles III</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-39-welcome-to-wrexham-39-about>What Is 'Welcome to Wrexham' About?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/welcome-to-wrexham-ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney-1.jpg><p>Welcome to Wrexham takes viewers on an extraordinary journey, from the glitz and glamor of Hollywood to the heart of Wales. Against the backdrop of a town steeped in history and tradition, the fate of a beloved football club and its passionate community hangs in the balance. Stepping into the town is none other than Reynolds and McElhenney, who, let's be honest, might not have the best knowledge when it comes to football. But they're willing to learn, and more importantly, they'd do whatever it takes to revive the club. Over the course of the previous season, audiences witnessed the duo's audacious attempts to breathe new life into the world's third-oldest professional soccer club, nestled in the working-class town of Wrexham in northern Wales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Reynolds and McElhenney step into unfamiliar territory, they grapple with the intricacies of a sport and industry entirely foreign to them. Their journey includes the daunting task of convincing star players and executives to take a chance on Wrexham. And if that's not enough for the two new club owners, an unexpected turn of events unfolds during the club's first home game under their ownership, leading to a police investigation and shedding light on the world of football hooliganism. A compelling tale of ambition and resilience, Welcome to Wrexham offers a raw look into the profound connection between a team and its town as they navigate the uncharted waters of history in the making. Below is the official synopsis for Welcome to Wrexham Season 2:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Rob and Ryan teamed up to purchase the 5th tier Red Dragons in the hopes of turning the club into an underdog story the whole world could root for. The world took notice and change is afoot. After a painful elimination in the playoffs, season two continues to track the club as they fight for promotion out of the National League and return to the English Football League. Dedicated staff and supporters hold on to the dream of returning the team and town to glory while bracing for the new-found challenges that fame has brought to their small community.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>'Welcome to Wrexham' Season 2 Poster Promises Glory for the Boys</a></span></p><h2 id=who-39-s-in-39-welcome-to-wrexham-39-season-2>Who's In 'Welcome to Wrexham' Season 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/welcome-to-wrexham-trailer-ryan-reynolds-social.jpg><p>Renowned for his magnetic and often humorous movie roles,<strong> </strong>Ryan Reynolds notably shone as the cheeky antihero Deadpool in the eponymous films and showcased his comedic prowess in romantic comedies such as <strong>The Proposal</strong>, co-starring <strong>Sandra Bullock</strong>.
