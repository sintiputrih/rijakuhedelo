Actor Daniel Radcliffe, who played Harry, says Griffiths’ “encouragement, tutelage and humor” made him a joy to work with.</strong></p><p>Thereof Is Mr Dursley dead? He is most known for his role as Vernon Dursley in the Harry Potter film series.<br>…<br>Richard Griffiths.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Richard Griffiths OBE</th></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>28 March 2013 (aged 65) Coventry, West Midlands, England</td></tr><tr><td>Resting place</td><td>St Mary The Virgin Churchyard, Bearley, Warwickshire</td></tr></tbody></table><p>How old is Mr Dursley? Vernon Dursley is a muggle <b>born on September 11,1954</b>.</p><p>Subsequently, Is Petunia older than Lily? Petunia Dursley (née Evans) (pre 1960 – pre 2020) was a Muggle, the eldest daughter of Mr and Mrs Evans, and the <b>older sister of</b> the Muggle-born witch Lily. … However, when Lily was killed by Lord Voldemort, Petunia became the guardian of her nephew, Harry Potter, who was only an infant then.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_does_Vernon_Dursley_hate_the_Potters></span>Why does Vernon Dursley hate the Potters?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rowling adds that Vernon hated Harry <b>because he saw father James in him</b>, much in the same way that Snape does. … It has been previously theorised that the Dursleys hated Harry because he was one of Voldemort’s Horcruxes – thus the magic around him warped their minds.</p><p>Is Aunt Petunia a squib? The theory stems from JK Rowling’s answer to a fan question during a 2004 conversation at the Edinburgh Book Festival. The fan asked the author if Aunt Petunia was a Squib (a non-magical person who is born to at least one magical parent) and Rowling replied: … <b>No, she is not, she is not a Squib</b>. She is a Muggle.</p><p>Was Petunia a Squib? The theory stems from JK Rowling’s answer to a fan question during a 2004 conversation at the Edinburgh Book Festival. The fan asked the author if Aunt Petunia was a Squib (a non-magical person who is born to at least one magical parent) and Rowling replied: … <b>No, she is not, she is not a Squib</b>. She is a Muggle.</p><p>What was in Vault 713? Vault 713 is the “top security” vault underneath Gringotts Bank where <b>Dumbledore kept the Philosopher’s Stone (PS5)</b>. Harry expected to see jewels and gold inside, but there was only the “grubby little package” concealing what he later realized was the Philosopher’s Stone (PS5, PS9). …</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_James_Potter_a_bully></span>Was James Potter a bully?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>James was a bully in school</b> — to the point that even the biggest of James Potter apologists can’t deny this. He mercilessly teased Snape, and in one particularly horrific memory, hung him upside down and exposed him in front of the entire school.</p><p>Why is Petunia not a witch? So according to one Tumblr user, Aunt Petunia actually <b>isn’t a Muggle</b> but a bitter ol’ witch, who suppressed her powers after being rejected by the magical community. The theory stems from JK Rowling’s answer to a fan question during a 2004 conversation at the Edinburgh Book Festival. … She is a Muggle.</p><p>Why was Petunia not allowed to go to Hogwarts?</p><p>Dumbledore responded saying that Petunia may not study at Hogwarts, and even though he responded kindly, Petunia <b>felt hurt and left out</b>, which also in part could have been because her parents were so proud of Lily’s talents.</p><p>Did Petunia go to Lily’s funeral? Apparently Petunia arranged the funeral for Lily and James, choosing for <b>them to be buried in Godrics Hollow</b>. Petunia was the only member left of Liliy’s and James’ family so it was left for her to do.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Dudley_have_a_magical_child></span>Did Dudley have a magical child?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Another fact about Dudley was revealed by Rowling after the books. … Rowling talked about how <b>she almost gave Dudley a magical child himself</b>. She considered having him be at Platform 9 ¾ during the epilogue.</p><p>What did Dumbledore’s Howler to Petunia mean?</p><p>Dumbledore had a sufficient foresight as to what would happen after the attack. He immediately dispatched a howler to Petunia. The howler <b>reminded her that Harry’s fate thus, would be the same for her family, if she decided to let him go, and break the charm.</b> <b>Hence she decided to let him stay.</b> <b>Not</b> for his protection.</p><p>Who sent the howler to Petunia? A Howler from <b>Dumbledore</b>, addressed to Petunia, said ‘Remember my last’ – no doubt referring to the letter which he left with baby Harry, on the doorstep of Privet Drive. But there was another occasion when Albus had a reason to write, and it had long-lasting consequences.</p><p>Is Hermione a Squib? Hermione is <b>a witch born to muggle parents but has magic in her blood</b>. The term that describes this occurrence is called a squib. A family can pass down magic genes that await for the right combination of genes in parents to create a child that is a witch or a wizard even if they are muggles themselves.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_vault_is_Harry_Potters></span>What vault is Harry Potters?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Vault 687</b> in Gringotts Wizarding Bank belongs to the Potter family. It appears to be of moderate depth and deeper underground than the vault of the Weasley family, but not as deep as Vault 713. It is accessible only by a Mine Cart operated by one of the bank’s goblin employees, and by using a small gold key.</p><p>Who emptied vault 713? It is unknown who is the owner of the vault or what, if anything, the vault was used for after it guarded the Philosopher’s Stone. , Read the series over 6 times. The Vault 713 in Gringotts held the Philosopher’s Stone. It was removed by <b>Rubeus Hagrid</b> on the 31st July 1990.</p><p>What was in the letter Hagrid gave to the goblin?</p><p>Letter information</p><p>The letter presumably requested permission to transfer <b>the Philosopher’s Stone</b> from Vault 713 to Hogwarts Castle, as a greater degree of security than even the bank’s vaults provided was deemed necessary by Dumbledore.</p><p>What is James Potter’s animagus? James Potter</p><p>James’s Animagus form was that of <b>a stag</b>, which earned him his nickname, Prongs. Strikingly, Harry’s Patronus was a stag and his mother Lily’s was a doe, a female deer, showing that the family’s characters were in harmony and formed part of the same animal group.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Harry%E2%80%99s_dad_bully_Snape></span>How did Harry’s dad bully Snape?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This faltered slightly where his father was concerned. He learned that James had been something of a <b>bully in his</b> youth, witnessing a memory of Snape’s, in which James and Sirius picked on and humiliated Snape simply because they were bored.</p><p>What did James do to Severus? Following an O.W.L. exam, James, with partner in crime Sirius Black, confronted the vulnerable young Snape, pinned him to the ground, filled his mouth with pink soap bubbles then lifted him into <b>the air</b>, threatening to completely undress the pale, slight Slytherin boy in front of a giggling crowd of fellow students.</p><h2></h2><p>Don’t forget to share this post 🖤</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1kxKm7jKmjmrGVmXq3sdGnpqdllKq%2FtLjEsmSipl2drrO%2B2GanqKykmr9ufo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-played-vernon-dursley-in-harry-potter-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-played-vernon-dursley-in-harry-potter-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-played-vernon-dursley-in-harry-potter-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-played-vernon-dursley-in-harry-potter-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-played-vernon-dursley-in-harry-potter-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-played-vernon-dursley-in-harry-potter-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dan-jennings-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dan-jennings-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html>Dan Jennings Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jonas-brothers-waffle-house-song.html>The Jonas Brothers' Song &amp;quot;Waffle House&amp;quot; Is a Bop!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jonas-brothers-waffle-house-song.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
