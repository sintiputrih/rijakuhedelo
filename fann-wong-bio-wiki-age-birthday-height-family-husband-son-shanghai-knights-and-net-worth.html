One of her earliest successes was in an <strong>Oil of Ulan</strong> (now <strong>Oil of Olay</strong>) commercial aired in Taiwan and Singapore. The following year, a Singaporean television producer discovered her and cast her in Dreams Come True a Singapore drama series. Fann soon starred in two more Singapore television series, The Challenger and Chronicle of Life.</p><p>After a year within the Singapore television industry, her role in <strong>Chronicle of Life</strong> won her Best Actress and Best Newcomer awards at Singapore’s 1995 Star Awards. In 1996, her role within the <strong>Unbroken Cycle</strong> won her first regional nomination at the Asian Television Awards. She continued to star during a large array of drama serials, including <strong>A Romance</strong> in Shanghai (produced in Shanghai), <strong>Wild Orchids</strong> (filmed in Sydney), and <strong>Brave New World</strong> (filmed in Amsterdam and Belgium).</p><p>In late 1996, Wong released in Singapore her first Mandarin pop album Fantasy, which contained a duet (theme song of her TV drama ‘Brave New World’) with <strong>Taiwanese singer Jeff Chang</strong>. The album was retitled <strong>I Live Alone</strong> and repackaged with two additional songs for the Taiwanese market and won 4 IFPI platinum sales awards in Taiwan, marking the beginning of Fann’s regional success.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-late-1990s-the-rise-of-regional-popularity></span><strong>The late 1990s: the rise of regional popularity</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 1996, Wong starred in the 40-episode blockbuster drama, <strong>Brave New World</strong>, alongside her now-husband, <strong>Christopher Lee</strong>, and <strong>Hong Kong actor Alex Man</strong>. This was the primary time ever that Wong would act alongside <strong>Christopher Lee</strong>. Wong also performed the theme song, “<strong>Don’t let love become hard for us</strong>“, as a duet with <strong>Taiwanese singer Jeff Chang</strong>.</p><p>In 1998, Wong was named the feminine lead, Xiaolongnü, in TCS remake of the hit wuxia drama <strong>The Return of the Condor Heroes</strong> where she once more starred alongside <strong>Christopher Lee</strong>. The release of this drama, alongside her second album, <strong>Shopping</strong>, further increased her exposure in Taiwan and China. When <strong>Hong Kong director Derek Yee</strong> saw Wong’s “<strong>Shopping</strong>” music video on Hong Kong’s Channel V, he flew to Singapore to cast her as the lead actress in the Hong Kong art film The Truth About Jane and Sam.</p><p>The movie topped the Singapore box office for 3 weeks and her role as a gritty wild-child won her a Best New Performer nomination at the 19th <strong>Hong Kong Film Awards</strong> in 2000. In addition, her role as a self-centered stockbroker in <strong>Out to Win</strong> attracted a million viewers in Singapore during its finale. It was during this period when Fann acquired many of her die-hard fans, led by the Fann-attic Fan Club (FFC).</p><p>In 1999, Wong released her third album <strong>Missing You</strong>, recorded “<strong>Private Number</strong>” with British boyband 911, and performed <strong>Moments of Magic</strong>, Singapore’s official millennium song.

That same year, she released her fourth Mandarin album, <strong>No Problem</strong>.</p><p>During the subsequent few years, Wong focused on her acting career.

She also began hosting travelogue shows, including <strong>Travel Hunt</strong>: <strong>Japan and Wong Adventure</strong>, which was filmed in South Africa and Malaysia.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2003-hollywood></span><strong>2003: Hollywood</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2002, Wong became the primary Singaporean actress to play a serious role during a Hollywood production as Chon Lin in <strong>Shanghai Knights</strong>. When the film was released in early 2003, <strong>Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post</strong> stated: Wong is a fascinating new film presence. Clearly modeled after <strong>Zhang Ziyi of Crouching Tiger</strong>, <strong>Hidden Dragon</strong>, she combines a dancer’s grace with a fighter’s speed, and looks great standing still or whirling.</p><p><strong>The Hollywood Reporter’s David Hunter</strong> noted that Wong was “more than adequate to playing the strong woman fighter who’s also pretty darn cute”, while <strong>John Keenan</strong> of the <strong>Omaha World-Herald</strong> stated that “Wong’s stunt work is really more memorable than <strong>Jackie Chan</strong>‘s here”.</p><p><strong>In Hong Kong</strong>, the <strong>South China Morning Post</strong> stated that she “seems set to displace Lucy Liu as Hollywood’s Asian babe du jour”. She was subsequently nominated under the simplest Fight category in MTV Movie Awards 2003, and in 2004, won the Singapore Street Festival’s Best International Artist Award.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2004%e2%80%932007></span><strong>2004–2007</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2004, Wong continued acting in China period dramas like Moon Fairy and My Fair Lady.

Wong also became the first Singaporean artist to release a self-illustrated 3D animation titled <strong>Fantasy World</strong>. The release of her Singapore film <strong>Just Follow Law</strong>, during which she had to play an uncouth and scruffy man during an adult female body, was a serious attraction at the Chinese New Year box office and won her critical acclaim in Singapore and Malaysian media.</p><p>In 2008, she was invited to be a judge at the sixth “<strong>spirit of fire</strong>” <strong>international film festival</strong> which was held in Russia. Ah, <strong>Long Pte Ltd</strong> reached No. 1 in both Singapore’s and Malaysia’s box office during the <strong>Chinese New Year</strong>. Later, the film <strong>Dance of Dragon</strong> that she paired with <strong>Korean hunk Jang Hyuk</strong> led her to win her first <strong>International Best Actress</strong> at the <strong>West Hollywood International festival</strong>.</p><p>In 2009, Wong starred with then-<strong>boyfriend Christopher Lee</strong> within the Wedding Game. The movie won the simplest feature at the primary international comedy festival held in Thailand. In June, she finished her new Chinese movie during a tangle.

Both of them were on the screen in late 2010. She filmed another comedy film <strong>Happy Go Lucky</strong>, which was shown during the Chinese New Year.</p><p>In 2010, she slowed down her step and only two dramas were filmed.

Two more Singaporean dramas followed in 2011.</p><p>But 2012 seemed to be a busy year for Wong.

Later she flew to Shandong and played a spicy wife within the movie <strong>Ai Shui Shui</strong> alongside <strong>Jaycee Chan</strong>, and also a telemovie <strong>Han di hu lue zhu GUI</strong> based on the novel <strong>Water Margin</strong>. Another movie <strong>Runaway Woman</strong> was filmed in Xinjiang in May.</p><p>She was awarded the “<strong>2012 Huading hottest Asian Actress Award</strong>” in <strong>Beijing Olympic Sports Centre</strong> on 4 July. Though she didn’t release new album for years, she was still invited to perform at <strong>9th Asia Song Festival</strong> which was held in <strong>Yeosul, Korea</strong>, on 4 August. In October, she flew to Xinjiang again to film the amount drama <strong>Tun Shu Xi Jiang</strong> about revolution occurring in Xinjiang.

But today, the 46-year-old is no longer worried, as she has realized that beauty encompasses myriad aspects. Fann, who graced the official opening of the new beauty gym Bella Marie France last Wednesday as its celebrity ambassador, told The New Paper: “As I grew older, I started to feel that beauty is what you exude from within.</p><p>“Outer beauty remains important due to the primary impression you give others. But as I matured and need to know myself better, my self-confidence and self-assurance slowly increased also .” Fann said her definition of beauty has changed, especially after becoming a mum to her son Zed, who is nearly three.</p><p>She said: “When you look and feel so sloppy and sweaty after an extended day, but your son still looks at you wish you’re the foremost beautiful woman on earth, that was once I realized that it had been beating the attention of the beholder.” Fann also said her skincare routine underwent a drastic change thanks to motherhood. From a 10-step routine, it’s been reduced to the fundamentals.</p><p>“I used to make do-it-yourself facials and scrubs and put on body slimming cream. But now, I do not even apply toner,” she said. “My morning and evening rituals are quite similar. I just cleanse my face, and put on moisturizer and eye cream.” She said she places an emphasis on eye cream because the eyes are the windows to the soul.</p><p>“Everyone will check out your eyes once they check out you, and it’s even more so for us artists. Whenever we are filming, we express ourselves a lot through our eyes. Furthermore, (the area around them) has very thin skin, so we’ve to require care of it carefully,” she said.</p><p>At Bella Marie France – a one-stop unification of expertise from Bella Skin Care and Marie France Bodyline – which Fann frequents “often” for “me time”, her favorite treatments are the 360 Turnaround for a serious boost of skin hydration and targeted fat reduction, and therefore the i-Laser Sculpt fat burning treatment for the body. Fann’s husband, the local actor Christopher Lee, doesn’t compliment her the maximum amount as before, but “he will always complain why I buy to eat such a lot but yet continue to stay so slim”.</p><p>She said with a laugh that he has been saying that every day since she had Zed. Her must-have beauty product is lip gloss, and she or he makes sure she features a tube in her bag, her car, and Lee’s car in the least times. Fann is going to be starring in two projects with Lee – it’s been eight years since their last collaboration. The first is Yi Nian, which was shot in Beijing and is scheduled to open at the top of the year, and therefore the second is Channel 8 drama Doppelganger slated for release next year.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-fann-wong></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Fann Wong</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-fann-wong></span><span>Who is Fann Wong?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wong is a Singaporean actress, singer, and model.
