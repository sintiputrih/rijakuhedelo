He said Thomas was also noted for his fearless support to the protection of the environment.</p><p>Chief Minister Vijayan said the state has lost a noted parliamentarian through his demise.</p><p>Mr Gandhi, who was touring his Wayanad constituency in north Kerala, cancelled all his programmes hearing about the demise of Thomas.</p><p>“I’m saddened to know of the demise of Shri P T Thomas. Along with his various contributions to the Congress party and the state of Kerala, he will be remembered for being a vibrant, helpful person. My condolences to his family and friends”, Mr Gandhi tweeted.</p><p>Mr Gandhi will visit Kochi to pay his homage to the departed soul, party sources said.</p><p>Former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said Thomas was very courageous in the stance he took on protection of the Western Ghats.</p><p>“He paid a price for it but never wavered. I salute his boldness & commitment. He belonged to a rare & vanishing breed of politicians”, Mr Ramesh tweeted.</p><p>Party sources said the body of Thomas is being brought to Kochi via road from Vellore.</p><p>His eyes were donated at the Vellore hospital as he had wished for.</p><p>As per his wishes, his body will be cremated at a Ravipuram crematorium in Kochi tomorrow and his ashes will be placed in the tomb of his mother in Upputhara in Idukki district.</p><p>Leader of Opposition Satheesan said as per his wishes, no wreaths would be kept on the body when it is placed for homage.</p><p>Mr Satheesan said he had penned that noted Malayalam poet and lyricist Vayalar Ramavarma’s famous song “Chandrakalabham Chaarthiyurangum Theeram” should be played in low voice during the cremation.</p><p>Congress leaders said Thomas’s last rites will be performed as per his wishes.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno5q7qrvRZpqoppensrS%2FjKajmmWgqXq1tM6mmKxllJ6ytHnIp2StmZ2euW66wJ2saA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsenior-congress-mla-pt-thomas-dies-in-tamil-nadu.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsenior-congress-mla-pt-thomas-dies-in-tamil-nadu.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsenior-congress-mla-pt-thomas-dies-in-tamil-nadu.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsenior-congress-mla-pt-thomas-dies-in-tamil-nadu.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsenior-congress-mla-pt-thomas-dies-in-tamil-nadu.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsenior-congress-mla-pt-thomas-dies-in-tamil-nadu.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-gwyneth-paltrow-blames-herself-for-her-failed-relationships.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-gwyneth-paltrow-blames-herself-for-her-failed-relationships.html>Why Gwyneth Paltrow Blames Herself For Her Failed Relationships</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pradeep-patwardhan.html>Pradeep Patwardhan- Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pradeep-patwardhan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
