People wait in long lines to buy them. It can be super boring — people will line up as early as right after their Thanksgiving dinner and even spend the night camping out so they can be one of the first to score a new XBox, LOL doll, towels on super sale at Walmart, etc...</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">These are the craziest Black Friday fights of all time.</h2><p>But don’t be fooled. People aren’t always nicely waiting in line. Black Friday can bring out the worst in people&nbsp;(seriously, they act like they're in <a href=#>The Purge</a> or something). There have been fights, stampedes, serious injuries, and even deaths thanks to the temporarily low, low prices on hot items.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve found the craziest headlines and stories from Black Friday over the years to prove it.</p><p>You’ll be glad you decided to shop online.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Panties Panic</h2><p>A Victoria’s Secret store was absolutely wrecked in 2012 by customers who were throwing punches at each other over underpants. An employee told a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>local Fox news</u></a> station that, “After the doors were open, customers there went crazy, climbing up on the ‘panty bar,’ throwing clothes and boxes, pushing and shoving and trampling each other. She said one girl got hit in the head with a box and another, punched in the stomach.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS KCAL 9</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Toy Terror</h2><p>In 2014, two female customers had the cops called on them after they pushed, shoved, and punched over an on-sale Barbie doll. “The whole thing was pretty stupid,” an eye-witness told a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>local CBS station</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Black Friday Death Count</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Black Friday Body Count</h2><p>There were five Black Friday-related deaths in 2018 according to the website, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Black Friday Death Count</u></a> which has been recording since 2010. Four of them involved shootings either inside the mall or in a parking lot. The other was a fatal stabbing inside a Macy’s.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStockphoto.com</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">X-Boxing&nbsp;</h2><p>A reddit thread about Black Friday horror stories has some absolute gems. And by gems, we mean nightmares.&nbsp;</p><p>"So it was the year the Xbox 360 came out,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>writes reddit user Ruckus55</u></a>. “I was standing in line to get some external hard drive next to the video games. And there was this 11ish-year-old kid with a woman in her 60s. He was waiting for his 360 bundle. The woman before him had 'gotten the last one,' sighs all around.</p><p>Then he says 'nope one more' and begins the motion of handing it to the kid and this guy comes out of nowhere and pushed the older woman and the kid. The kid hit his face on the edge of a video game rack, you know the one with the metal and plastic dividers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>At 19 years old, I don't know what came over me, but I instantly swung for the dude's head and caught him right in the temple sending him into a Keurig tower in the middle of the Isle. Everyone froze, including me. Guy had dropped the 360 and got up and walked away. I slid it with my foot to the kid and he didn't say anything either."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fabric Fiasco</h2><p>In the same thread, a Joann Fabric and Crafts employee wrote about an old lady tackling and macing a customer over some pink ribbon fabric</p><p>“The woman was wheeling a cart in the store with several large bolts of the fabric in it (which she had special ordered, and we put it in the cart for her so she could continue shopping). Old lady sees that this woman has 'ALL the bolts' and it isn't right that she's hogging the entire stock of that particular print.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><p>The woman explains the situation and that she in fact special ordered these, and that the reason she was coming in on Black Friday to purchase them is because they were a major Black Friday promotion at 60 percent off. The old lady continues to yell at the poor woman. The woman very calmly keeps trying to reassure her that she is not taking any of the store stock, and that she makes blankets for dying women with breast cancer.</p><p>She is a very sweet store regular who pays out of pocket for all the blankets, and so my store held the fabric for her until Black Friday, when she would come in and purchase them with her coupon.</p><p>Old lady doesn't give a sh-t. Whips out mace and tackles the woman.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7mir8pmnauhlJbGbrLIoJ%2Btqw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fblack-friday-fights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fblack-friday-fights.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fblack-friday-fights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fblack-friday-fights.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fblack-friday-fights.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fblack-friday-fights.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-masked-singer-recap-the-ravens-identity-is-revealed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-masked-singer-recap-the-ravens-identity-is-revealed.html>The Masked Singer Recap: The Ravens Identity Is Revealed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ora-12006-a-materialized-view-with-the-same-user-name-already-exists.html>ORA-12006: a materialized view with the same user.name already exists</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ora-12006-a-materialized-view-with-the-same-user-name-already-exists.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
