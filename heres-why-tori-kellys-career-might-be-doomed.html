In June 2019, the music and management mogul nicked a lucrative deal to acquire Big Machine Records, which included the prestigious master recordings from all of its artists including Taylor Swift.</p><p>Braun is also the founder of SB Projects, a diversified entertainment, and media company focused on ventures integrating television, music, film, technology, and more.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber Shares Defiant ‘Date Night’ Selfie After Fans Accuse Him Of Selena Tattoo</a></span></p><p>On top of that, he owns his own record label, titled Schoolboy, and he’s managing a handful of artists, including Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Carly Rae Jepsen, J Balvin, The Black Eyed Peas, Ashley Graham, Usher, David Guetta, just to name a few.</p><p>Over the summer of 2019, pop star Demi Lovato <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">became one of his latest clients</a> as she signed a management deal with the 39-year-old, who strategically helped the former Disney star land the opportunity of performing the national anthem at the Super Bowl earlier this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not to mention, he also booked Lovato to perform her heartfelt ballad, Anyone, at the Grammys in January as the Sorry Not Sorry gears up for the release of her highly-anticipated seventh album.</p><p>But with all that he has going on, Kelly’s fans are under the impression that Bruan is not focusing enough attention on the former American Idol contestant, who became a semi-finalist on the FOX series during its ninth run in 2010.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber Fans Go Crazy After Video Leaks Of Him In The Studio With Justin Timberlake</a></span></p><p>She’s released three albums to date, but with each new release, the sales continue to decline, which has left many wondering what’s going on behind the scenes that are causing Kelly’s career to take a huge hit while other artists managed by Braun continue to excel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it’s unfair to draw comparisons between singers, Grande’s fifth studio album, Thank U, Next, which was released in February 2019, broke records for accumulating the most single-day streams on Spotify with nearly 8.2 million spins in just 24 hours.</p><p>It became the ninth best-selling album of that year while Kelly’s third studio album, Inspired by True Events, which dropped in August 2019 peaked at a shocking No. 97 on the Billboard Hot 200.</p><p>But is Braun fully to blame for the singer’s lack of commercial success? In 2015, the famous manager took part in a candid chat with Billboard, telling the publication that while he considers Kelly one of the most talented women he’s had the pleasure of working with, the father-of-three thinks that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the public finds her unexciting</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber’s Fan Reaction Video Proves He Truly Cares How His Music Is Received</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I remember telling her, 'You're the most talented person I know, but you're boring. People think you're ­boring. They think you're vanilla,' " he gushed. "But Tori is ­resilient. The next day she came to my house and said, 'I wrote a song about what you said, and it's called 'Unbreakable Smile.’”</p><p>And while things started looking up for the songstress with a string of successful songs on the charts, things went downhill by the time her sophomore project rolled out in September 2018.</p><p>“Honestly, I think she should just leave Scooter Braun because he’s too busy working with other artists,” one annoyed fan said on Twitter. Another had similar things to say, stressing: “She would have so much more success if she left Scooter’s imprint because he’s not helping her career in any way.”</p><p>Kelly is believed to be working on her fourth album but fans can only hope that this project will fare better than her predecessor, which just about managed to enter the Top 100 on Billboard’s Hot 200, peaking at No. 98.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything There Is To Know About Justin Bieber’s Manager, Scooter Braun</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmq6iqmWK4prjLsqpmm5Gnsqa%2BjKagoKCkYq%2BmecOopqadlGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-why-tori-kellys-career-might-be-doomed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-why-tori-kellys-career-might-be-doomed.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-why-tori-kellys-career-might-be-doomed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-why-tori-kellys-career-might-be-doomed.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-why-tori-kellys-career-might-be-doomed.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-tori-kellys-career-might-be-doomed.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jacob-bixenman.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jacob-bixenman.html>Jacob Bixenman - Bio, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dan-bakkedahl-biography.html>Dan Bakkedahl Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dan-bakkedahl-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
