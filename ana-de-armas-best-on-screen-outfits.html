With<a href=#>&nbsp;Knives Out&nbsp;</a>newly released and five movies in production (including the newest 007 flick), we thought we'd throw it back to all of this lady's best flicks.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Knives Out: Net Worth Of The Main Cast, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Of course, despite her incredible versatility, this intelligent woman is also absolutely stunning. We think we could all use some tips from her wardrobe, right? In case you need a refresher, here are Ana's 10 best on-screen outfits that this bombshell absolutely slayed.</p><h2 id=cute-floral-amp-denim---exposed-2016>Cute, Floral, & Denim - Exposed (2016)</h2><p>This crime drama stars this brilliant gal alongside the infamous <a href=#>Keanu Reeves</a>. From Exposed, Ana sports some pretty incredible looks. This denim jacket and adorable floral dress is definitely catching our attention, and that red lipstick is the perfect cherry on top.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She looks adorable, but she's also turning heads and looking drop dead gorgeous. This movie is full of crime and action, but we can confidently say that Ana de Armas managed to remain absolutely stunning the entire way through.</p><h2 id=casual-amp-curly---the-informer-2019-2020>Casual & Curly - The Informer (2019/2020)</h2><p>This bold and edgy look is from the underrated crime drama, The Informer (2019), which is a fairly new flick for this gal (PS: This film actually doesn't come to the States until January, 2020). Ana jumps on the crime wagon again, but this time she's showing us some pretty impeccable curls.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Ridiculously Expensive Things Keanu Reeves Has Bought</a></span></p><p>We know these outfits are different, but their style is similar enough that we thought we'd include them as one item. That jacket and jewelry is definitely worthy of being added to our closets, not to mention those cute jeans and white over-shirt. She's certainly stunning in both of these looks, and we want to become this look immediately.</p><h2 id=all-black---blade-runner-2049-2017>All Black - Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</h2><p>It's probably not surprising that this movie will pop up a few times on this list. <a href=#>Blade Runner 2049</a> is probably her largest role to date, and she is slaying the entire film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This all black outfit is different, edgy, and totally mesmerizing. We don't know what's going on, but we want a version for ourselves immediately. Simple, sleek, and yet totally bold and stunning. This movie is a roller-coaster, but we can count on Ana to blow us away in every scene she's in.</p><h2 id=cozy-cute-sweater---knives-out-2019>Cozy Cute Sweater - Knives Out (2019)</h2><p>In her newest blockbuster film, Knives Out, Ana plays the nurse at the center of a high profile murder, and her leading role is quirky and brilliant. She's cute as a button in this flick, and we're digging this sweater and floral, yellow collared shirt.</p><p>Seriously, she looks so comfy, and still manages to look incredibly beautiful. This movie is phenomenal, and we couldn't help but include this adorable look on this list.</p><h2 id=the-beach-look---war-dogs-2016>The Beach Look - War Dogs (2016)</h2><p>Ana de Armas plays Miles Teller's wife in the biography crime comedy, War Dogs. We know this woman is beautiful inside and out, but this beach look deserves some recognition of its own.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">No Time To Die: 10 Things We Know So Far About Bond’s Last Movie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Only she could pull off a neon pink bikini, but we also want to borrow that white over-shirt every time we head to the beach. She looks beautiful, and is certainly one momma that isn't afraid to look bold and stunning.</p><h2 id=the-yellow-jacket---blade-runner-2049-2017>The Yellow Jacket - Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</h2><p>Blade Runner 2049 strikes again, because we quite literally couldn't help but fall in love with this look. Sure, maybe only this futuristic bombshell could pull it off, but it certainly deserves some love. That black turtleneck is amazing, but our eyes are locked onto that yellow coat.</p><p>We're not sure what it's made of or where it came from, but it definitely has our attention. The wardrobe designer of this movie deserves some mad props, but we're pretty sure only Ana could look as stunning in this bold coat.</p><h2 id=dress-amp-boots---exposed-2016>Dress & Boots - Exposed (2016)</h2><p>This look is also from the film&nbsp;Exposed, because we couldn't help but acknowledge another adorable outfit. This simple, navy blue dress is picture perfect, and those boots are something we definitely want to steal from her closet.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Highest-Grossing Ryan Gosling Movies of All Time</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She looks elegant, professional, stunning, and cute all at once, and this is an outfit we'd borrow in a heart beat. Plus, it'd be perfect for so many different occasions.</p><h2 id=sparkly-dress---knock-knock-2015>Sparkly Dress - Knock Knock (2015)</h2><p>This sparkly knock-out dress is from Knock Knock, where she actually stars alongside Keanu Reeves again. This drama thriller is filled with themes of seduction, and we're confident that these ladies do a pretty stellar job.</p><p>That dress is beautiful, and its sparkly awesomeness is perfect for this gem of a woman. Plus, we're actually loving this blonde bob, and we're officially convinced that Ana can pull off any hair color.</p><h2 id=edgy-pink-amp-black---por-un-pu-ado-de-besos-2014>Edgy, Pink & Black - Por un puñado de besos (2014)</h2><p>We all know this bombshell is Cuban, and she's been in her fair share of Spanish films. This look is from Por un puñado de besos (2014), a drama romance starring this wonderful gal. This black top is stunning, and we'd like to right a formal request to borrow it.</p><p>Of course, her jewelry, nails, and hair definitely also deserve some recognition. Like we said, she can pull off any hair color, and this faded pink look is certainly no exception. She's edgy and beautiful, and is definitely stealing our hearts in this film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-futuristic-floral---blade-runner-2049-2017>The Futuristic Floral - Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</h2><p>We thought it fitting to close this list off with one of her most iconic looks from her most critically-acclaimed film. Once again from Blade Runner 2049, Ana de Armas wouldn't exactly be Joi without this classic dress. This character is phenomenal, but her outfits from this film could seriously make up a list in itself. Ana is brilliant and beautiful, and this dress makes this character even more infatuating.</p><p>We're not sure we could borrow this by today's standards, but the colors, fit, and material are all worthy of a standing ovation. We're in love with this actress, and clearly, we'd also like to steal her wardrobe, but this dress is for Ana and Ana only.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Scarlett Johansson’s Best On-Screen Outfits, Ranked</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8CnmGaclWKus7nArGSbnaOperC6jKyaq52Vo3qwwdOfoK2rXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fana-de-armas-best-on-screen-outfits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fana-de-armas-best-on-screen-outfits.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fana-de-armas-best-on-screen-outfits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fana-de-armas-best-on-screen-outfits.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fana-de-armas-best-on-screen-outfits.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fana-de-armas-best-on-screen-outfits.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chase-hayes-obituary-oklahoma-city-chase-hayes-has-died.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chase-hayes-obituary-oklahoma-city-chase-hayes-has-died.html>Chase Hayes Obituary, Oklahoma City, Chase Hayes Has Died</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./254128-abigail-breslins-father-has-died-after-c-html.html>'Little Miss Sunshine' Star Abigail Breslin's Father Passes Away after Contracting COVID-19</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./254128-abigail-breslins-father-has-died-after-c-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
