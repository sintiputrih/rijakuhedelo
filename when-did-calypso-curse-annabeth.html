This scarf has the power to make people fall in love. That's the reason why Annabeth took it away from Percy so quickly, knowing that the scarf could enchant him.<h2>How old is Thalia in Titan's Curse?</h2>Thalia Grace: Thalia is a 15-year-old demigod daughter of Zeus. Though she appears in Percy's dream in the first book, she makes a full appearance at the end of The Sea of Monsters and is given a greater role in the third book.<h2>Does Percy lose his Achilles curse?</h2>One of these places is the Tiber River at Camp Jupiter, which has the ability to wash the curse away.
