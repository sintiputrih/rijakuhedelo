When Bully Ray asked when Cody knew that it was time to depart <a href=#>All Elite Wrestling</a>, Rhodes admitted it was when he was in Chicago, though he didn’t provide a specific timeframe.</p><p>“I can tell you specifically where I felt like I knew that it needed to happen for me was the Loews Hotel over by Rosemont, which is by Allstate Arena,” Cody Rhodes said. “WWE regularly runs Allstate for Chicago, but I looked at Brandi, and I told her. The last time I told her something like that was when I told her I was leaving WWE. I just had kind of done it all in my mind. And I was just sitting there at that little bar right to the right side and a little corner booth, and I knew, and I mentioned it with the RAW interview that I did, and I was so excited to be able to do that type of interview on Monday Night RAW last week. It was an easy decision.</p><p>“After the heaviness and hardness of what that departure would mean, the decision was easy in terms of what I needed to do next. I even mentioned it yesterday. I’m so proud of everything. From every independent I went to, which is every single one on Earth, it felt like. To New Japan, to Ring of Honor, to All In, to All Elite Wrestling, I’m so proud. But that block being filled really made just provided that clarity for me. I have to take a shot at this. Everyone’s different; everybody wants to be the best pro wrestler, the best superstar, whatever the nomenclature is, but I had a real goal at eight years old that I did get the chance, but I wasn’t ready. I failed at the chance, and I liked it so much more about losing than it is about winning, and I absolutely felt like I could make the run at it here. I could, whether it’s unobtained is one thing, but I didn’t want it to go unfed, and I didn’t want it to go untried.”</p><p>The American Nightmare went on to reveal out of everyone new on the WWE roster he got to meet; he was most excited to meet newly crowned RAW Women’s Champion Bianca Belair.</p><p>“I tell you, the person I was most excited to meet was Bianca Belair,” Cody Rhodes revealed. “I was most excited to meet her, and I got to meet her when she had just come back from tearing the joint down, and I was underneath the stage so I could hear it all. And you’re always happy when you can hear a hot crowd, and they had set up such a brilliant crowd and put us in a difficult position to follow, and I just thought she was just a total Queen when I met her and to be able to be one of the first people to say congratulations. Even though I’m brand new on the team, that was very nice, and I’m a big fan of having watched her last year with what she did was with Sasha. Big fan, so that was one that was very exciting for me.”</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=#>Tony Khan On Cody Rhodes’ WWE Return: I Lost A Very Prominent Free Agent, But We’ve Gained Several Others</a></p><p>What do you make of Cody Rhodes’ comments?
