She is best known by her first name,&nbsp;Mýa.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The singer has been active in the music industry for over two decades and has collaborated with many other artists. Throughout the years, she has garnered many awards.&nbsp;</p><p>While Harrison is very active in the entertainment industry, she has kept her life relatively private, and significantly less is known about her personal life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Here are a few facts about the singer - from the meaning of her name to her relationship status.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Does Mya Mean?</h2><p>The singer herself has never mentioned the true meaning behind her name. Still, various websites online have interpreted the meaning behind 'Mýa.' <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to Scary Mommy</a>,&nbsp;Mýa is the "variant of Mia and Maya." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>It has a lot of variations that have various sources, like Greek, Arabic, and German.&nbsp;The name usually means "beloved" or "great." However, Mýa&nbsp;also means "a million years ago,"&nbsp;a scientific unit of measurement.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">As noted by The Bump</a>, many young girls were named Mya around 1998 because of the singer's influence.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mya and Veganism&nbsp;</h2><p>Mýa was a long-time vegetarian before becoming a vegan in 2014. She discussed her lifestyle with Hot 97 in May 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>The singer opted for veganism after she lost 30 pounds. Her skin cleared up, she had more energy, and she felt better as a whole. Even her doctor was shocked looking at&nbsp;Mýa's transformation.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She shared her lifestyle on Instagram, and many people took it as a challenge.&nbsp;Mýa herself followed up with the challenge one step at a time. Eventually, she took the raw vegan challenge where the food was not cooked past 118 degrees.</p><p>This way, she could consume as many nutrients as possible from everything she ate. This way, she could maintain her body since she lost fat in all the right places.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, she began sculpting her body by exercising and lifting weights.&nbsp;Mýa has also promoted a vegan lifestyle for People For The Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Mya's Relationship History</h2><p>The singer has always been private about her relationships. She has been linked with many people in the past, but&nbsp;Mýa has debunked it all.&nbsp;</p><p>There were rumors about her dating Jay-Z, but like usual, it was not true. Regardless, she has been in a relationship with two people in the music industry and others outside the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we will never know who they are, since&nbsp;Mýa doesn't&nbsp;share the names of the men she has dated. A relationship is a sacred thing for the singer.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Her intention has always been love and connection with the other person and never a public stunt. Her managers and publicists have asked her to date another famous personality, but the singer does not entertain such requests.&nbsp;</p><p>Mýa's current relationship status is unknown. In the interview with Hot 97, she claimed she was single and focused on herself after she got a wake-up call from her previous relationship.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She had a dysfunctional relationship with a guy in 2013, which&nbsp;was&nbsp;unhealthy for the singer. She used to prioritize him and focus on him instead of herself and her family.&nbsp;</p><p>She lost herself in that relationship, so she walked away from it. She fixed her mentality, and now she does not want to be in that position again. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Mya's Music Career&nbsp;</h2><p>Mýa&nbsp;started her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">music career</a> in 1998 when she was just 18 years old. Her contemporary-oriented R&B songs were appreciated by many people, which helped her gain a massive fan base at a young age.&nbsp;</p><p>She soon started collaborating with various artics like Babyface, Lil' Kim, <a href=# rel=follow>Christina Aguilera</a>, P!nk, <a href=# rel=follow>Missy Elliott</a>, <a href=# rel=follow>Robin Thicke</a>, Diane Warren, Timbaland, and Wyclef Jean.</p><p>In 2008, she established her label, Planet 9. To date,&nbsp;Mýa has released&nbsp;eight studio albums, three extended plays, one mixtape, 28&nbsp;singles, and 30 music videos.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She has won 27 awards out of 60 nominations, including&nbsp;Billboard Music Video Awards,&nbsp;Grammy Awards,&nbsp;MTV Video Music Awards,&nbsp;My VH1 Music Awards,&nbsp;Teen Choice Awards, and&nbsp;Washington Area Music Awards.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mya's Acting Career&nbsp;</h2><p>Mýa has acted in various movies and series.&nbsp;Sister, Sister,&nbsp;In Too Deep,&nbsp;Haunted,&nbsp;Chicago,&nbsp;Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,&nbsp;Shall We Dance,&nbsp;Cursed, NCIS,&nbsp;The Penthouse,&nbsp;Gods of Medicine,&nbsp;5th Ward, and&nbsp;Lazarus are some projects she has worked on.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWplnqnrcKtqmegpKK5</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmya-facts-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmya-facts-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmya-facts-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmya-facts-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmya-facts-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmya-facts-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lala-kent-james-kennedy-react-tom-sandoval-ariana-madix-split.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lala-kent-james-kennedy-react-tom-sandoval-ariana-madix-split.html>Lala Kent &amp;amp; James Kennedy React To Tom Sandoval &amp;amp; Ariana Madixs Split Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./randy-savage-always-liked-the-ultimate-warrior.html>Randy Savage Always Liked The Ultimate Warrior</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./randy-savage-always-liked-the-ultimate-warrior.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
