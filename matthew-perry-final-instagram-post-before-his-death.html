His cause of death was said to be due to drowning; first responders were responding to a call for cardiac arrest.</p><p>It's stated that Matthew was found in the jacuzzi on his property, but as TMZ noted, the exact location was unknown. Details were limited upon the first report, but TMZ suggested there was no foul play involved and that there were no drugs found on site.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/matthew-perry-dated-julia-robert-during-friends-but-ended-it-in-fear-of-getting-his-heartbroken.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Matthew Perry Dated Julia Robert During Friends But Ended It In Fear Of Getting His Heartbroken</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>They dated during Friends, however, thinks took a turn between Matthew Perry and Julia Roberts.</span><p>It was not suspected that substances were involved in Matthew's passing, but of course, only time and any toxicology reports or autopsy results will confirm that report.

While older posts on Perry's Instagram had a few hundred comments each, his final post from October 23rd had racked up thousands of comments within an hour of the report that he had passed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew's last Instagram post</a> featured a snapshot of him in a hot tub at nighttime, ostensibly at his Los Angeles-area home.

It was assumed by most that the hot tub in the photo was the very place where Matthew was found and received medical attention.</p><p>The heartbreaking irony wasn't lost on fans; one commented, "How is his last post of him in a jacuzzi?! So sad ðŸ˜ž." Another wrote, "This is so eerie now ðŸ˜­ RIP Chandler Bing."</p><p>Another echoed, "Could this post BE any more ominous? ðŸ˜¢," while thousands of other comments hoped Matthew would rest in peace.</p><p>A handful of fans suggested that someone should delete Matthew's final post, especially if that was the place where he passed away, but it's unclear whether anyone would have the power to do that, or whether they would want to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet amid the tragedy, there were happier signs in Matthew's latest posts, including some clues that suggested whatever happened to him, it was likely not self-inflicted.</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-seemed-to-be-looking-forward-to-a-new-project>Matthew Perry Seemed To Be Looking Forward To A New Project</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/friends-cast-at-the-friends-reunion.jpg><p>Looking back at Perry's other recent posts, fans were somewhat baffled by him referring to himself as "Mattman," but there was a trend that had fans hoping for Matthew's appearance in a specific film franchise.</p><p>In his more recent posts, which came after a stretch of inactivity on social media, Matthew Perry posted all manner of Batman puns and graphics; one post featured a snap of the moon in the sky, with a shaky image of possibly another moon shaking over it.
