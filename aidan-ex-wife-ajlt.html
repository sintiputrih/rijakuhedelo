At the end of SATC, Carrie chose Big, whom she eventually married. Sadly, their romance was cut short when Big died of a heart attack in the first episode of the SATC reboot, <a href=#>And Just Like That</a>.</p><p>After a year of mourning the “Big” love of her life in AJLT Season 1, Carrie and Aidan, who is very much alive, reconnected in Season 2 on Valentine’s Day — because why not?</p><p>As they sat across from one another in S2, Ep. 7, “February 14th,” Aidan told Carrie it seemed like no time had passed since they’d last seen each other 10 years prior. However, day-one fans of the series know that a lot has changed between these two — including Aidan being a married man with kids.</p><p>After their reunion, fans wonder what happened to Aidan’s wife, Kathy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Max</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Aidan confirmed Kathy is now his ex-wife on ‘And Just Like That.’</h2><p>Although they reconnected in SATC Season 4 and almost got married, Carrie and Aidan chose other partners with whom they thought they would spend the rest of their lives. For Carrie, it was Big, and for Aidan, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a woman named Kathy</a>.</p><p>Kathy was initially introduced to SATC fans in Season 6, Ep. 1, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“To Market, To Market,”</a> though we never saw her face. While carrying their first son, Tate, whom he nicknamed “Tater,” Aidan told Carrie he married Kathy, an interior designer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Max</a></figure><p>Kathy is mentioned again in the second SATC movie when Aidan and Carrie unexpectedly reunite in Abu Dhabi, where they also kiss.</p><p>In <a href=#>Sex and the City 2</a>, Carrie felt guilty about kissing Aidan while she was married. While Big and Carrie worked through their problems, fans had a few theories about what happened to Aidan and Kathy.</p><p>On AJLT, Carrie confirmed to <a href=#>Charlotte (Kristin Davis)</a> and <a href=#>Miranda (Cynthia Nixon)</a> that Aidan is divorced and lives in Virginia with his children. She didn’t explain what caused the split, though one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">popular fan theory on Reddit</a> was that Aidan also confessed to Kathy about the kiss, but that it ended with the two of them divorcing instead of working it out.</p><p>Once they reconnected, Aidan also didn’t share why he and Kathy split but confirmed he was very much single. During their dinner, he joked that he had “gained 40 lbs” because he doesn’t have “someone special.” At least, not until now.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: HBO</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Carrie and Aidan’s reunion means she will likely interact with her ex’s kids.</h2><p>In the final scene of S2, Ep. 7 of And Just Like That, Carrie and Aidan FINALLY find themselves, as Carrie put it, “on the same page.” Although Aidan doesn’t feel comfortable going into Carrie’s apartment yet, because it was the same place they ended their engagement 20 years prior, he vowed to get a hotel close to Carrie so they could see each other more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Max</span></figure><p>With Aidan and Carrie finally getting their second (really, fourth at this point) at love, the two lovebirds must meet one another where they are now. For Aidan, that includes his sons Homer, Wyatt, and Tate.</p><p>Our calculations show Homer, Wyatt, and Tate are in their early twenties and late teens. Still, as Carrie previously showed us in the SATC episode <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“A Woman’s Right to Shoes,”</a> kids and the fashionista don’t mix, so it will be interesting to see how the dynamic unfolds.</p><p>Catch new episodes of And Just Like That streaming Thursdays on Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflralrc1mnLFlp56zpnnAo6Ot</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faidan-ex-wife-ajlt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2faidan-ex-wife-ajlt.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2faidan-ex-wife-ajlt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2faidan-ex-wife-ajlt.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faidan-ex-wife-ajlt.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2faidan-ex-wife-ajlt.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./frog-video-goes-viral-on-twitter-full.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./frog-video-goes-viral-on-twitter-full.html>Frog Video Goes Viral on Twitter: Full</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./was-temuera-morrison-skipped-over-for-ahsoka.html>Was Temuera Morrison skipped over for Ahsoka?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./was-temuera-morrison-skipped-over-for-ahsoka.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
