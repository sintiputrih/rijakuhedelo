Here you’ll learn about their age, their job, and their children. Plus, we discuss their activism and lawsuits in this article.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Zoe’s mom and dad.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Zoe Sozo Bethel Parents?</strong></h3><p>Zoe Sozo Bethal was born to her parents Glynis and Orlando Bethal. Her parents had earned fame as serial lawsuit filers and evangelists. They gained fame and local media attention through public antics in addition to legal battles with the school board, other government entities, and businesses.</p><p>Her mother, self-described “fire and brimstone preacher” and her husband had filed a 12-page complaint in U.S. District Court in Nashville. She had garnered more attention after moving to Nashville in 2010.</p><p>In September 2011, Glynis caused the Baldwin County school system to go into lockdown because of a threatening phone call. She was held without bail at Baldwin County jail. The jail record listed several charges including obstructing government operations, harassment, disorderly conduct, third-degree criminal trespass, criminal coercion, and fugitive charges.</p><p>Glynis, in April 2011, sued an Ohio school district for $1 million over an incident involving a T-shirt worn by Zoe which inscribed “god hates whores” and “repent or burn in hell.”. By that time, they had filed over 50 similar federal lawsuits, mostly in the South.</p><p>Back in 2002, Zoe’s father Orlando was asked to sing at Glynis’s uncle’s funeral claimed that he had a revelation from God that led him to insult mourners and say that the dead man was damned. He told 100 mourners they were “fornicators” and “wh***mongers.”</p><p>Glynis and Orlando moved from Miami to rural Alabama in early 2000. They settled on an acre of land his Glynis inherited from her grandfather. <i>The advocate</i> had listed the Bethel family as one of the 11 “The Haters” groups to watch out for in March 2012.</p><p>The outlet wrote, “Glynis Bethel and husband Orlando Bethel travel the country with their three teenage daughters in their “<a title="Hell Van" href=# rel=noopener>Hell Van</a>,” which is emblazoned with messages about “wh***-mongers” and the like. They’ve helped out the Westboro Baptist Church on protests and have a thing for homemade T-shirts.”</p><p>Zoe’s parents had also authored a book titled <a href=#>Be a MODEL for the GOSPEL</a> (Biblical Answers to Questions About S**).</p><h3><strong>Meet Zoe Sozo Bethal Mom, Glynis Bethel</strong></h3><p>Zoe Sozo Bethal’s mom was Glynis Bethel.

I didn’t understand then, but I appreciate her for watching over me.”</p><p>She possibly died of breast cancer sometime after 2010. People who knew her described her as “seamstress, pianist, vocalist, teacher, model, and World Traveller”.
