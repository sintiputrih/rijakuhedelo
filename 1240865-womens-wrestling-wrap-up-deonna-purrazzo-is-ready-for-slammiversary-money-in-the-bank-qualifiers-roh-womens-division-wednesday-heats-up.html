Amongst the RAW women’s division matchups were two tag team matches, where the victors both earned their respective spots in the traditional Money In The Bank ladder match. The first qualifying match of the evening featured former RAW Women’s Champion, Asuka teaming with Naomi, against the new team of Eva Marie and Doudrop (formerly known as Piper Niven in NXT UK). This match ended when Eva Marie called for a tag into the ring, but Doudrop (Piper Niven) dropped from the apron and refused to tag in, and thus, allowing Naomi to take down Eva and pick up the win for herself and Asuka.</p><p>Later in the night, Nikki Cross debuted a new superhero persona and teamed with her former partner, Alexa Bliss to take on former WWE Women’s Tag Team Champions, Shayna Baszler and Nia Jax, in a Money In The Bank qualifying match. Bliss and Cross picked up the win after a hypnotic distraction from Bliss allowed Nikki Cross to roll up Baszler for the victory, cementing themselves in the women’s Money In The Bank match next month.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=#>Nikki Cross Rebrands As A Superhero, Upsets Shayna Baszler On WWE RAW</a></p><p>Also announced for Money In The Bank: Rhea Ripley will defend her RAW Women’s Championship against Charlotte Flair.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>With a huge score to settle, <a href=#>@MsCharlotteWWE</a> will clash with <a href=#>@RheaRipley_WWE</a> for the <a href=#>#WWERaw</a> <a href=#>#WomensTitle</a> at <a href=#>#MITB</a>!<a href=#>https://t.co/Q9QE0xF8Hk</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>June 22, 2021</a></p><h4>Renee Paquette, Brandi Rhodes Announce Birth Of New Daughters</h4><p>The wrestling world welcomed two new members into the community last week.
