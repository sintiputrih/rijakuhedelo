The Canadian medical drama walks us through the obstacles Dr. Bashir Ahmed aka Bash goes through to resume his career in medicine at York Memorial Hospital in Toronto.</p><p>Nora was introduced to the Transplant viewers in the Season 1 finale. As Bashir and Amira were leaving, viewers saw a woman standing at the front desk of the hospital. Recognizing the woman, Amira ran screaming into her arms. Bashir simply looked at her and said, “I thought you were dead.” Viewers then learned the mystery woman’s name was Rania.</p><p>Since Bashir had not seen or heard from Rania since he escaped Syria, seeing her stand there was a moment of shock for him. Things quickly escalated when Rania told Bash that she was aware of where he and his sister Amira were the entire time.</p><p>According to E-News, Rania is Bashira’s fiancee and Bash had left her in Syria after he fled to Canada with his sister Amira.</p><p>Rania announced her part in Transplant only on January 3, 2022, through her Instagram handle.</p><h3><strong>Nora Geurch Age</strong></h3><p>Nora Geurch was reportedly born in the year 1986, which means her age was either 35 or 32 as of March 2022.</p><h3><strong>What Is Nora Geurch Ethnicity?</strong></h3><p>Nora Geurch’s ethnicity is Moroccan-Canadian.</p><p>To talk a little about her family, we know that her mom’s name is Khadija Gue.
