television.&nbsp;In 2003, she acted as a flight attendant in the comedy film,&nbsp;</span><span>Anger Management</span><span>.&nbsp;His acting credits further include&nbsp;</span><span>The 40-Year-Old

id=her-husband-steve-carell></span><strong><span>Her husband, Steve Carell</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>Once named as America’s Funniest Man in Life’s Magazine, Steve has been nominated for the Golden Globes nine times.&nbsp;American actor, comedian, producer, writer and director.&nbsp;Born August 16, 1962 in Concord, Massachusetts, USA.</span></p><p><span>Versatile in his roles, he is known as Michael Scotts&nbsp;</span><span>The Office</span><span>, wrestling coach and convicted murderer John Eleuthère du Pont in the 2014 drama film&nbsp;</span><span>Foxcatcher</span><span>.&nbsp;This role earned him, among other distinctions, to be nominated for an Oscar for best actor.</span></p><p><span>Among his other works, he is also a prominent correspondent from 1999 to 2005 on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.&nbsp;Steve Carell was inducted onto the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2016 for his contributions to the motion picture industry.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=their-beautiful-love-story></span><strong><span>Their beautiful love story</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>A marital union spanning more than two decades in an industry renowned for its rocky relationships is worthy of acclaim.&nbsp;It’s just a far cry from the pattern that’s been seen in Hollywood with celebrity marriages and relationships where separation and divorce are more like a default setting in such unions.</span></p><p><span>This is not to say that marriage is problem free or has had its storm free sail, but it is more like a survivor amidst all the inconveniences and many challenges that such a union battles.&nbsp;Nancy Carell and Steve Carell have been married since 1995 and have remained one of show business’s strongest couples.&nbsp;Let’s take a look at their cute love story.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-they-meet></span><strong><span>How did they meet?</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>The beautiful love story presented in the troupe,&nbsp;</span><span>The second city</span><span>&nbsp;where Nancy was a student in a class taught by Steve.&nbsp;However, contrary to what you might think, the two comedic forces didn’t get along at first, despite being attracted to each other.&nbsp;Steve revealed that asking her out was kind of a herculean task as he kept beating around the bush for a long time.</span></p><p><span>He first thought that the lady he was interested in (Nancy) hated him because she acted calm around him even though he knew at first sight that she was his.&nbsp;But the truth was that she was just as nervous as he was and was just trying to act cool.</span></p><p><span>Still, the thought of possibly being rejected brought to mind his memory of the first girl he called out on a date in eighth grade.&nbsp;He received a NO for an answer, and from that time until Nancy’s acceptance, was cautious in his journey.</span></p><p><span>He didn’t start off on a fancy note but said something like if he had to ask someone out, it would be someone like her.&nbsp;Stupid right?&nbsp;But guess what?&nbsp;Nancy was right to give him a more awkward answer.&nbsp;She replied that if someone like Steve asked her out, she would definitely go out with him.&nbsp;If ever such a person existed and was certain, Steve was there of course.&nbsp;They were already in love with each other but didn’t know how to present their case.</span></p><p><span>In any case, this was only the beginning of their happily ever after.&nbsp;They then won a date and had their first date at the Green Mill jazz club.&nbsp;The tandem bonded on August 5, 1995. The journey was characterized by endless happiness.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-life-children></span><strong><span>Family life, children</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>The couple share the same sense of humor, although Steve doesn’t think his wife is an easy laugh.&nbsp;He counted that as one of the many reasons he loves her.&nbsp;He considers Nancy the best indicator of the quality of jokes and says she challenges him intellectually and comically.&nbsp;Comically because she’s not someone who’s going to laugh at everything everyone does.</span></p><p><span>He then added that Nancy Carell, his wife is the smartest and funniest person he has ever met.&nbsp;And that he had never assumed that such a smart and attractive woman would be remotely interested in him.</span></p><p><span>She played her husband’s love several times.&nbsp;For example, in&nbsp;</span><span>The Office</span><span>&nbsp;where she portrayed a friend of hers and appeared with him on a number of shows, including&nbsp;</span><span>The Daily Show</span></p><p><span>Nancy Carell said of her husband that he was very funny and didn’t try so hard.&nbsp;They have two children, daughter Elisabeth (born May 25, 2001) and son John “Johnny” (born June 2004).</span></p><p><span>Predictably, their children seem to have inherited their parents’ sense of humor, described by their parents as very pure and honest in an interview.</span></p><p><span>The super-cute couple own a home in Los Angeles, as well as Marshfield, Massachusetts, where they have the option of escaping celebrity life during the summer.&nbsp;The duo also own The Marshfield Hills general store which they bought in 2009.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ynmKebqWKwor7EpaNmq6Saw6Z5wpqpnqScqHq4tcWeZJ%2Bhnpl6sMHTZquhnZmneqTB055kpaemmnq0wM6rsGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-nancy-carell-steve-carells-wife-find-out-their-cute-love-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-nancy-carell-steve-carells-wife-find-out-their-cute-love-story.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-nancy-carell-steve-carells-wife-find-out-their-cute-love-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-nancy-carell-steve-carells-wife-find-out-their-cute-love-story.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-nancy-carell-steve-carells-wife-find-out-their-cute-love-story.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-nancy-carell-steve-carells-wife-find-out-their-cute-love-story.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-plays-sam-obisanya-dad-ola-obisanya-in-ted-lasso-622844-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-plays-sam-obisanya-dad-ola-obisanya-in-ted-lasso-622844-html.html>Who Plays Sam Obisanya Dad Ola Obisanya In Ted Lasso?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jason-varitek.html>Who is Jason Varitek dating?
