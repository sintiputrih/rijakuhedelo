<time>01 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=#><strong>Morgan Evans</strong></a> released a “heavy” new song in the wake of his split from <a href=#><strong>Kelsea Ballerini</strong></a> — and some fans think it sounds a lot like <a href=#>one of his ex’s hits</a>.</p><p>Evans, 38, shared a video of himself <a href=#>performing the song</a> — titled “Tequila Man” — acoustically via <a href=#>TikTok</a> on Tuesday, July 18. In the caption, he hinted that <a href=#>the tune was inspired</a> by “some heavy stuff I think a lot of people go through but never talk aboit [sic].”</p><p>In the footage, Evans strums his guitar as he somberly croons, “Felt like my whole life just turned to hell / She told me that there was somebody else / Going on a year or two / She just had to tell the truth.”</p><p>He continues: “I took off my ring and took off out the drive / With a wave of hurt and rage across my mind / I guess I followed my heart [and] wound up in this bar.”</p><p>Evans asks for a drink in the chorus, singing, “I’ll take a tequila, man / Pour one up tall and strong as you can / One that might just make me forget everything / Fill me up again with tequila, man.”</p><p>While plenty of fans <a href=#>praised Evans’ songwriting</a> in the comments section — with one noting they hoped his “heart is healing” post-divorce — others claimed the melody sounded familiar. “Why does the beginning sound like leave me again,” one user asked, <a href=#>referring to a ballad released by Ballerini</a>, 29, earlier this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/morgan-evans-drops-heavy-new-song-after-kelsea-ballerini-divorce-inline.jpg><p>Another viewer teased, “And I hooooope IIIII never leeeeeeave me again – me singing along.”</p><p>Ballerini and Evans <a href=#>were married for nearly five years</a> before announcing their split in August 2022. “This deeply difficult decision is the result of a journey of love, growth, and effort that ultimately has come to an end. It’s hard to find the words here … but <a href=#>I feel extremely grateful</a> for the years of marriage to Morgan and hopeful for the next seasons,” Ballerini wrote via her Instagram Story at the time.</p><p>In a statement of his own, Evans hinted that <a href=#>the decision to call it quits</a> may not have been mutual. “I am very sad to confirm that after almost 5 years of marriage, Kelsea and I are parting ways,” he wrote via his Instagram Story. “I wish it were otherwise but sadly it is not.”</p><p>As the pair’s divorce sent shockwaves through <a href=#>the country music scene</a>, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that <a href=#>the singers “had no choice but to officially separate”</a> after previously taking a break “privately.” The insider added that Ballerini and Evans were “working on their marriage for many years” and went to therapy before their split.</p><p>Ballerini filed for divorce in August 2022, and <a href=#>the twosome reached a settlement</a> three months later. After moving on with boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Chase Stokes</strong></a>, Ballerini released an emotional EP on Valentine’s Day that <a href=#>delved deeper into her breakup</a>.</p><p>“Leave Me Again” — the final song on the record — describes her wishes for her and her ex-husband in their new chapter. “I hope when I see you that you smile / I hope that you find somebody new / I hope that you get the house, and the good wife, and the kids / And I hope I never leave me again,” she sings.</p><p>Evans previously released <a href=#>a song inspired by the duo’s divorce</a> last fall titled “Over for You.” During a February interview on the <a href=#>“Call Her Daddy”</a> podcast, <a href=#>Ballerini confessed that she felt “really used”</a> after hearing the song.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I felt like it was really opportunistic for him to put that out when he did — when we were still going through the legalities of getting divorced. … His healing journey is his healing journey and I respect that,” she said. “But publicly exploiting it feels a little nasty to me — before it [was] final.”</p><p>At the time, Ballerini revealed that <a href=#>she and Evans hadn’t been in touch</a> since they broke up. “Who you marry is not who you divorce. … And I have grace, I really do, because I do know that he was hurt and is hurt,” she added. “But how was I married to this person for so long and I had no idea that that bit of character was tucked within that human being? That’s what’s hard for me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSoqpeWu26x1ZqlrGWUp7yxv4yhnJquqWK7psOMrKann12Ws7Wx0WainqSjmq5ursClo56qmaO2brDIr6arm5Vk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmorgan-evans-drops-heavy-new-song-after-kelsea-ballerini-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmorgan-evans-drops-heavy-new-song-after-kelsea-ballerini-divorce.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmorgan-evans-drops-heavy-new-song-after-kelsea-ballerini-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmorgan-evans-drops-heavy-new-song-after-kelsea-ballerini-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmorgan-evans-drops-heavy-new-song-after-kelsea-ballerini-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmorgan-evans-drops-heavy-new-song-after-kelsea-ballerini-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./drake-memes-on-the-internet.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./drake-memes-on-the-internet.html>Top 10 popular Drake memes on the internet so far</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jordan-really-dead.html>Jordan really dead? - The Young and the Restless</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jordan-really-dead.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
