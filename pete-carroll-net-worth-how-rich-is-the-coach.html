He returned to school and graduated with a master’s in physical education.</p><p>Pete was then employed by Lou Holtz at the University of Arkansas as a graduate assistant. He went on to play more roles at Iowa State University and North Carolina State University, where he served as an assistant coach. After that, he gave the NFL a go, starting as the Buffalo Bills’ defensive backs coach.</p><p>Pete Carroll eventually became the New York Jets’ head coach in 1994.

The property sold for $6.1 million to him.</p><p>Even though he and <strong><a href=#>his wife Glena</a></strong> paid $5.9 million for the home less than a year ago, it’s crucial to remember that even though this could seem like a big windfall, given that they didn’t receive much of a return, it was unclear why the Carrolls decided to move on so soon.</p><p>The house is 3,860 square feet in size and has three bedrooms. A separate guest apartment, a mooring dock, and a private beach are some further delights.</p><p>Pete sold a second house in Manhattan Beach, California, in 2016. $2.05 million was the sale price of the beach property, $50,000 over the asking price.</p><p>The 1,200-square-foot home has two bedrooms, a brick terrace, and breathtaking views of the ocean. Carroll had held onto this house for a long time because he paid only $540,000 for it when he first bought it in 1999. Pete was renting it out for $4,500 a month for a while.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pete-carroll-salary-how-much-does-he-get-paid><strong>Pete Carroll Salary: How Much Does He Get Paid?</strong></h2><p>We know Pete Carroll’s net worth to be 50 million dollars; what about his salary?
