It debuted at number 187 on the Billboard 200. It covers his personal life in great detail, including the birth of his first son and his partner's battle with breast cancer.</p><p>In an interview with Hip-Hop Kings at the 2015 Fresh Island Festival, Evidence confirmed he would be releasing a new solo album in 2016 via Rhymesayers. Evidence confirmed that DJ Babu and Alchemist will feature on the record. As of July 2015 he had around five songs recorded, and the album was to be submitted for mastering no later than January 16.</p><p>Evidence's second studio album, Cats & Dogs, was released on September 27, 2011. The album charted at number 64 on the Billboard 200, making it his first album to appear on the chart. An album sampler mixed by DJ Babu was released as well. The album won 2011 HHUG Best Album of the Year.</p><p>In an emotional interview on Conspiracy Worldwide Radio, Evidence discussed his 2011 projects, including the status of Dilated Peoples, a future DJ Premier collaboration and citing the problems he had with the internet releasing his music before he does.</p><p>On July 17, 2009 it was announced that Evidence had signed a deal with Minneapolis-based hip-hop label Rhymesayers Entertainment, with a YouTube video showing Evidence signing the contract to release his next album.</p><p>With production from <a href=#>The Alchemist</a>, Sid Roams (producers Joey Chavez and Tavish "Bravo" Graham), Jake One, DJ Babu, <a href=#>DJ Khalil</a>, and Evidence himself, the album The Weatherman LP was released March 20, 2007.</p><p>Perretta was close with his mother; "I Still Love You" and "Chase The Clouds Away" are both tributes to her. She died due to cancer in 2004. Writing and performing "I Still Love You" was emotionally challenging for Evidence, a single child whose mother was his best friend and confidante. "I produced it, I rapped on it and I recorded it by myself with nobody in the room because I couldn't have anybody around when I was doing it," he explains. "It's the one time you're definitely going to get all of me."</p><p>Shortly after meeting QD3, Evidence teamed with the like-minded Rakaa to form the group Dilated Peoples and after the success of their 1997 single "Third Degree" b/w "Confidence" and "Global Dynamics" on ABB Records – and the addition of DJ Babu to the fold a year later—the group quickly became a fixture on the hip hop tour circuit. They hoped their success would serve as a platform for solo projects, much as the Wu-Tang Clan's success had done before them.</p><p><a href=#>Michael Taylor</a> Perretta (born December 10, 1976), known professionally as Evidence, is an American rapper and record producer from Venice, Los Angeles, California. He is also a member of the group Dilated Peoples, as well as being one-half of Step Brothers with <a href=#>The Alchemist</a>.
