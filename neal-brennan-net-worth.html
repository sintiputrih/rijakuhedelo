He is a writer, stand-up comedian, actor, director and producer, probably best known for co-creating the Comedy Central series “Chappelle’s Show”.</p><p>A famous comedian, how rich is Neal Brennan now? Sources state that Brennan’s net worth reaches $7 million, as of mid-2017. His wealth has been earned during his career as a writer, director and producer, as well as through his performances as an actor and comedian.</p><h3>Neal Brennan Net Worth $7 Million</h3><p>Brennan was raised in Villanova, Pennsylvania along with nine older siblings; his family moved to Wilmette, Illinois when he was five years old. He became interested in comedy while still a child, and began performing comic acts at school. During his high-school years, his brother Kevin began doing stand-up comedy, and Brennan often attended his brother’s performances at New York’s comedy club The Improv, where he got a chance to meet famous comedians such as <a href=#>Ray Romano</a>, Mike Royce and David Juskow. After matriculating, Brennan moved to New York City to enroll in film school at New York University. However, a year later he left the school and got a doorman job at the Boston Comedy Club in Greenwich Village, becoming a roommate of the comedian <a href=#>Jay Mohr</a>. It was here that he met the famous comedian <a href=#>Dave Chappelle</a>, who was a regular performer at the club, and with whom Brennan soon formed friendship.</p><p>In 1992, being aged 18, Brennan did his first stand-up performance, which turned out to be quite unsuccessful. The same year he became a writer of the magazine “The Source”.</p><p>Upon moving to Los Angeles in the mid-90s, Brennan began working as a writer for the game show “Singled Out”. He later served as a writer for the game show “Bzzz!”, the sketch comedy-variety show “All That” and the television sitcom “Kenan & Kel”.</p><p>In 1997 he collaborated with Chappelle, producing the screenplay for the comedy film “Half Baked”, in which he also had a small part. In 2003 the two teamed up again, as the creators, writers and executive producers of the comedy sketch television series called “Chapelle’s Show”, inspired by Tom Shales’ 2002 book “Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live”. It gained high popularity, and during its second season, the show became the highest-rated program of the Comedy Central network. In 2005, after the show’s first two seasons had been aired, Chappelle suddenly left for South Africa, just before the third season’s premiere, without telling Brennan anything about his departure. This delayed the premiere, leaving Brennan to gather the remaining sketches and air them in 2006 as the ‘lost episodes’. Nevertheless, “Chappelle’s Show” brought Brennan three Emmy Awards in 2004 for his work as the show’s director, writer and producer, and significantly contributed to his net worth.</p><p>Brennan went on to co-write and direct the parody television film “Totally Awesome” in 2006. In 2009 he directed the comedy film “The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard”, and took a minor part in the comedy film “Get Him to the Greek” of the following year. In 2011 he was the director of a series of commercials for the ESPY Award and wrote comedy material for the 83rd Academy Awards, and for Seth Meyers’ speech at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.</p><p>The same year he started a podcast called “The Champs” along with the comedian Moshe Kasher and DJ Douggpound. The show, featuring celebrities from musical, comedy, and sports-related backgrounds, was named “Best Podcast” in LA Weekly’s “Best of L.A.” issue in 2014. All added to his wealth.</p><p>Brennan served as the host of the show “Attack of the Show!” in 2012, and as a director of several episodes of the comedy sketch series “Inside Amy Schumer” the following year. Since 2014 he has hosted the comedy series ‘The Approval Matrix”. In 2015 he created and performed in a comedy show called “3 Mics” in L.A., bringing it to New York City in early 2016.</p><p>Speaking about his private life, Brennan seems to be very secretive. Therefore, there are no facts known to media about any romantic relationships.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=20.564971751412><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Neal Brennan</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$7 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 19, 1973</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 11" (1.8 m)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Stand-up comedian, Writer, Producer, Director</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Film school at NYU</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Kevin Brennan, Sheila Krezwick</td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/nealbrennan</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.38297872340426><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/nealbrennan/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0107366</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28070175438596><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/neal-brennan-mn0003328496</a></td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>ESPY Award (2011)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nominations</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing - Variety Series/Outstanding Directing (2004), PGA Television Producer of the Year Award in Variety Television (2005),</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Movies</td><td>"Neal Brennan: 3 Mics" (2017), "Half Baked" (writer, 1998), "Totally Awesome" (2006), "The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard" (writer, 2009), "Get Him to the Greek" (2010)</td></tr><tr readability=17><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Inside Amy Schumer" (2013), "Singled Out", "Bzzz!", "All That", "Kenan & Kel" (writer, 1997), "The Champs", "Chappelle's Show" (writer and director, 2003–2006), "The Approval Matrix" (since 2011), "Singled Out" (writer, 1996), "All That" (writer,1996–1997)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=13.614052953157><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=5.6842105263158><td>1</td><td>[on working with <a href=#>Dave Chappelle</a> again] The relationship is charred.
