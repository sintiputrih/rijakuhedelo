Being eliminated during the Playoffs in Season 6 didn't hurt the singer's career in the slightest. He immediately headed to Nashville where country music was calling his name. With four No.1 singles and a CMA award for New Artist of the Year, he certainly answered.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Then things took a turn after he was kicked off <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> in 2020 for violating COVID-19 protocols and soon after, was caught on a ring camera yelling racial slurs. This resulted in a swift removal of his songs from many country music stations. Morgan has also publicly <a href=#>battled addiction</a>. In April and May 2023, he canceled several shows <a href=#>due to vocal strain</a> but folks still rallied around him until he revealed a new haircut at a show. Why did Morgan Wallen shave his head? Fans are not OK.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Morgan Wallen shave his head? Change can be good.</h2><p>In the midst of his One Night at a Time Tour, Morgan Wallen briefly addressed his shaved head at the Columbus, Ohio, show on Aug. 11, 2023. He was wearing a baseball cap but it was pretty clear things were a bit lighter underneath. Understanding that his signature mullet was almost as much a part of him as his music is, Morgan took a moment to speak about his chrome dome.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement was shared</a> by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@countrycentral TikTok account</a> and it's clear Morgan was prepared for this moment. "Before we get any further, I didn’t like my long hair anymore, so I shaved it of," he revealed while smiling. The reaction in the crowd was largely supportive but Morgan didn't live in that space for long. "Back to business," he said while revealing the next song was "One Thing at a Time."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans are strangely angry about Morgan Wallen's shaved head.</h2><p>The response of fans to Morgan's shaved head really drives home the idea that a new haircut can be a devastating experience. Most women already knew this. It seems as if in every corner of social media that remotely involves Morgan, someone pops into the comments or replies to shake their fists at this abrupt change.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Morgan has yet to say anything on his own Instagram about his bald noggin, but the sheer (or should we say shear) terror is felt in the comments section under a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reel from July 31</a>. "YOU SHAVED YOUR HEAD" screamed one person in all-caps. Under that remark, another IG user added, "I'm grieving."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Woke up to an overwhelming amount of messages telling me Morgan wallen shaved his mullet and before you ask no I’m not ok</p>— John Gayly (@bootleghinata) <a href=#>August 12, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Many people are demanding Morgan grow his hair back as if he's Samson, and all of his strength and talent resides in his hair. Over on the Country Central TikTok, the feedback is even more intense. One person claimed to be "screaming, crying, and throwing up." Yet another is furiously Googling how long it takes hair to grow back. I thought we all knew that on average, most hair grows half an inch a month.</p><p>Thankfully there were plenty of jokes to offset the creepiness of the individuals who appear to have lost their minds. More than one person updated the lyrics from his song Last Night to reflect Shavegate. What was once, "Last night we let the liquor talk," became, "Last night we let the clippers talk." For the folks who believe in family, one person wanted to know, "What in the Dollar General Vin Diesel is happening?" Change is scary. Sometimes it can feel too fast, but there is no need to get furious.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aln6e0orqMsJilpJWjerS0wK%2BcZqCZqHqpscCd</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-morgan-wallen-shave-his-head.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-morgan-wallen-shave-his-head.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-morgan-wallen-shave-his-head.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-morgan-wallen-shave-his-head.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-morgan-wallen-shave-his-head.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-morgan-wallen-shave-his-head.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shopping-bars-clothing-watches-accessories.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shopping-bars-clothing-watches-accessories.html>4 New Shopping Bars Every Shopper Will Love</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./types-of-american-express-cards.html>Types of american express cards</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./types-of-american-express-cards.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
