Nadi won the gold medal in that tournament which made him the youngest foil gold medalist at the age of 18 years and 29 days.</p><p>Later, Nedo made his second participation in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">1920 Summer Olympics</a>. Nedo Nadi’s performance in the 1920 Olympics is still, in 2020, acclaimed as near to perfection as a fencer could execute.</p><p>In that tournament, he won the individual foil gold medal with a record of 10 wins in the final pool. In the same tournament, Nadi was selected for the team épée which annoyed his father, who regarded the épée as “a crude and undisciplined weapon”.</p><p>Unlike the foil and saber, in épée, any part of the body is a legitimate hit to make a score so Guiseppe considers it as an undisciplined weapon. Nevertheless, Nedo Nadi led his team to the Olympic final and secured a team gold medal for his country.</p><p>Nedo was perfect in the fence from all aspects. His perfect balance, timing, and rapid reflexes give him a big advantage in any style of fencing.</p><p>Thus, without much difficulty, Nedo won the individual saber gold medal by 11 victories to 9. With his victory, Nedo became the first and the only fencer ever to win a gold medal in each of Three weapons at a single Olympics</p><h2><span id=Death>Death</span></h2><p>After the 1920 Olympics, Nedo started his career as a professional coach and started coaching at the Buenos Aires Jockey Club.</p><p>Later, Nedo served as the president of the Italian Fencing Federation from 1935 to 1940.
