Premiering on 9 pm Monday 16th January 2022 on ITV2 and ITVX, this will be the reality show‚Äôs first winter edition since 2020. Shaq Muhammad is one of the singletons entering the villa to hopefully find his future wife there.</p><p>In the article below, let‚Äôs learn about Shaq‚Äôs new stint at Love Island, his age, job, family, dating status, and more.</p><h3><strong>Shaq Muhammad On Love Island 2023</strong></h3><p>Compared to the summer edition of Love Island which is filmed in Majorca, Spain,&nbsp; the winter edition instead takes place in Cape Town, South Africa. Reportedly, the villa of Love Island 2023 is worth more than ¬£5m as it has an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a rugby pitch, a zip line, a 400m running track, and a private lake. Also, Love Island 2023 will be the first series with Maya Jama as a host.</p><p>Besides Shaq Muhammad, the other singletons appearing in the ITV show are Tanya Manhenga, Kai Fagan, Lana Jenkins, Ron Hall, <a href=#>Anna-May Robey</a>, Will Young, Tanyel Revan, Olivia Hawkins, and Haris Namani.</p><p>Ahead of the show‚Äôs premiere, the TV network revealed some information about Shaq, including answers to questions such as why he is on Love Island and what is he looking for in a partner and other things.</p><p>Shaq shared that the reason he is entering the Love Island villa is that he hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhad the best luck with previous relationships.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúSo I thought, why not be in the sun and potentially meet the love of my life? Hopefully, I do come out with my future wife. The person I hope to marry one day. Hopefully, she‚Äôs in the villa.‚Äù</p><p>The Love Island 2023 contestant also shared that he still does not know what he‚Äôs looking for in a partner. However, he confessed that his family and friends would say that he‚Äôs quick to fall in love. Shaq said, ‚Äù I‚Äôm the type of person that wears my heart on my sleeve. If I find someone I click with, I fall very hard, very fast. Sometimes that can be a bad thing. I‚Äôm a very emotional person. It can be a blessing and a curse.‚Äù</p><p>Shaq also revealed one seemingly lesser-known fact about him. He shared that his favorite film is Dear John and he cries every time he watches that movie.</p><h3><strong>What Is Shaq Muhammad Dating Status?</strong></h3><p>Shaq Muhammad‚Äôs dating status was unclear as of January 2023. The reality TV star rarely shared anything about his dating life on his social media which made it difficult for us to extract any information about his relationships.</p><p>However, given that, the reality TV star is on Love Island, we guess he was single at the time of this writing.</p><h3><strong>Shaq Muhammad Age</strong></h3><p>According to bustle.com, Shaw Muhammad‚Äôs age was 24 ahead of Love Island 2023 premiere.</p><h3><strong>Shaq Muhammad Family</strong></h3><p>Regarding Shaq‚Äôs family information, his Instagram handle offers little to no help. The only time he shared something that was close to his family was when he made a post on his brother Che‚Äôs death. He uploaded some of his pictures with his deceased brother Che on Juen 26, 2021, and wrote, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll love you forever my brother Rest in ever peace Che,‚Äù in the caption.</p><h3><strong>Is Shaq Muhammad On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Shaq Muhammad is on Instagram <a href=#>@shaq24s_</a>, where he has more than 4.5 thousand followers. On the platform, Shaq usually shares his holiday photos, graduation pictures, and countertop fit checks. The reality TV star has not uploaded anything on his account since December 19, 2022, which makes sense as his IG bio currently reads: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm off to find love in the @loveisland villa. See you soon!‚Äô</p><p>You can find Shaq on TikTok as well.</p><h3><strong>Shaq Muhammad Height</strong></h3><p>Shaq Muhammad stands tall at a height of 6 feet. Based on his pictures on the Internet, the British lad has tattoos on his right chest and arm.</p><h3><strong>Shaq Muhammad Job</strong></h3><p>Coming to Shaq‚Äôs job, he is an airport security officer. As of January 2023, we, unfortunately, did not know any further details about Shaq‚Äôs job. However, we do have a figure for what Shaq might be earning. As per totaljobs.com, the average salary for an airport security officer is a little over ¬£20 thousand.</p><p>The Love Island 2023 star is a big-time traveler too. He often shares his vacation pictures on Instagram. In August 2021, Shaq was traveling around Spain and in 2022, Shaq posted many pictures from his holiday vacation in Toronto, Canada.</p><p>On March 31, 2022, Shaq graduated from his post-graduate studies graduation picture. He posted a picture of him in a graduation gown on his Instagram handle and several of his followers congratulated him on his achievement.</p><p>While we don‚Äôt know for sure, Shaq might‚Äôve done his master‚Äôs studies in Business Administration at Birmingham City University.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Shaq Muhammad Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Shaq Muhammad most probably celebrates his birthday on March 31st every year.
