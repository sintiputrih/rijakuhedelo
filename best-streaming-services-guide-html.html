Even during the early days of streaming, you could count on finding most big shows and movies on one of the big three platforms (Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video) or the digital versions of the big premium cable networks (HBO Now, Showtime).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckaocekjw02a43h67srp5gtod@published data-word-count=106>But it’s not so simple anymore: Since late 2019, there’s been a barrage of new platform launches as big media companies scramble for position in the post-cable universe. <a href=#>Apple TV+</a> and <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Disney+</a> came online in November 2019, while Peacock has hit living rooms and commandeered all episodes of The Office. A supersize version of HBO called, appropriately enough, <a href=#>HBO Max </a>made waves in 2020 and <a href=#>then came Paramount+</a>, a revamped and rebranded CBS All Access. All that on top of literally dozens of other smaller services and niche platforms for audiences with specialized tastes. Nobody ever said the streaming revolution would be cheap — or easy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckao00ez800193h67qgpludnb@published data-word-count=110>The good news is that, unlike cable, almost all streaming services let you try out their product before you have to fully commit. A seven-day trial is usually the minimum sampling period, but as competition heats up, some platforms have been giving away an entire month of service. Still, even figuring out which streamers to check out takes some digging — and that’s where Vulture has your back. We’ve put together a master list of dozens of subscription-based video platforms covering a range of interests, from movies and general entertainment to sports and education. We’ve tried to find streamers serving all sorts of tastes and communities both narrow and broad.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckao00f04001a3h67zwypxnf7@published data-word-count=105>A few notes: We want this guide to help you decide how to spend your money, so we didn’t include any platform that was completely free or ad-supported (think Pluto or STIRR). Many services try to make themselves look a bit less expensive by setting their prices at, say, $6.99 instead of $7; we opted to round up to the next dollar when listing costs. And one pro tip: Your cellphone company might offer free or discounted service to a streamer (see: <a href=#>Sprint’s Hulu promotion</a> or <a href=#>T-Mobile’s “Netflix on Us” offer</a>), so check their websites, too, or our guide to <a href=#>phone plans offering streaming discounts</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckao00r5l005h3h674nkydpi8@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Major Services</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ef1/dcd/ad384d31e7bae4dac120db075f2d5c912b-eastenders.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Ted Lasso, available on Apple TV+.<h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckao011cw005t3h678owin8b5@published><a data-vars-anchor-text=Netflix href=#>Netflix</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckao00f3m001d3h67lnz2zq29@published data-word-count=152>The everything store of original video entertainment is to streaming what Kleenex is to tissue: a brand so powerful it’s become synonymous with the category, <a href=#>even if it’s had a difficult 2022</a>. Netflix spends billions each year making its own original scripted and unscripted series, dozens of stand-up comedy specials, and a yearly slate of theatrical-quality feature films bigger than any of the major movie studios. Basically, Netflix’s goal is to recreate a cable TV package in one place, offering enough highbrow and lowbrow programming to fill a couple dozen very different networks. Its library of older shows and movies has shrunk somewhat in recent years as Disney, NBCUniversal, and other competitors have reclaimed their intellectual property (translation: you can’t stream Friends or recent Marvel and Star Wars movies on Netflix anymore). But there’s still a decent-size collection of retro goodness, including Seinfeld, Monty Python’s Flying Circus, 30 Rock, and Grey’s Anatomy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckao00f7w001e3h678mawhmxd@published data-word-count=12><strong>Cost: </strong><a href=#>$10 per month; $15.50 per month HD; $20 4K and HDR</a></p>Don't have Netflix? <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Sign up</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckao01gk100653h67pk3v6pc2@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Amazon Prime Video" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Amazon Prime Video</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckao00far001g3h67uhmepmlh@published data-word-count=136>Though it doesn’t make nearly as many originals as Netflix, Amazon’s video service is no slouch when it comes to first-run fare: It usually premieres a couple of big tentpole comedies or dramas every month, from critical darlings (Fleabag, Modern Love) to crowd-pleasing hits (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Bosch, Jack Ryan). Amazon simulcasts some Thursday night football games, too, and is also rapidly beefing up its first-run movie slate. It also boasts a far deeper collection of acquired movies and TV shows than Netflix, particularly if you’re looking for stuff from the 1970s and ’80s. And for better or worse, Prime also combines its subscription offering with stuff from Amazon’s video download and rental store: As you’re browsing through movies and shows included with the service, you’ll also be shown titles you can buy or rent.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckao00fbv001h3h67kyu4u62i@published data-word-count=13><strong>Cost: </strong><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>$9 per month or included with an Amazon Prime subscription; $119 annually</a></p>Don't have Amazon Prime Video? <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Sign Up</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckao01qn8006h3h67yv92h9tp@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Apple TV+" href=#>Apple TV+</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckao00fe5001j3h67ozdzco5m@published data-word-count=105>One of the few major streamers focused solely on original content, you won’t find a large library of older shows with hundreds of episodes to binge.

The service has also supersized its movie offering, with the addition of a couple thousand titles from the Paramount Pictures and MGM libraries. What’s more, newer Paramount movies now show up earlier on the platform, with some debuting as soon as one month after their theatrical debuts.

At the time, there were already two HBO streamers: HBO Go and HBO Now.<strong> </strong>HBO Go was how cable subscribers caught up with shows like Girls or Game of Thrones online.<strong> </strong>HBO Now, available since 2015, was a digital version of the premium cable channel, serving up the full lineup of current and past HBO series, movies, and feature films. Both have now been sunset, and WarnerMedia (<a href=#>now Warner Bros. Discovery</a>, with more change on the horizon) has consolidated its<strong> </strong>apps into HBO Max, which replicates everything offered on Now, but adds in thousands of additional hours of classic movies (Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, the Criterion Collection) and TV shows (Friends, The Big Bang Theory, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, South Park), plus original projects (an Anna Kendrick romantic comedy called Love Life, a reboot of Gossip Girl) and significant libraries from Studio Ghibli and DC Comics’ fleet of onscreen superheroes.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckao00fuy001x3h67y3nn5k1a@published data-word-count=17><strong>Cost: </strong><a href=#>$10 per month or $100 annually (with ads); $15 per month or $150 annually (no ads)</a></p>Don't have HBO Max? <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Sign Up</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckfipz5t0000c3h78ins31ldo@published><a data-vars-anchor-text=Peacock href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Peacock</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckfipzgd8000g3h78h5zmrqiu@published data-word-count=212>Its name is an homage to NBC’s peacock logo, and it is part of the same Comcast corporate family as NBC, so Peacock is really just NBC for streaming, right? Well, not really. It’s true that there’s a lot of NBC DNA in Peacock, including next-day reruns of some NBC primetime shows plus a library filled with stuff from either NBC (SNL, The Rockford Files, the Law & Order franchise) or Comcast-owned entities such as E!, Bravo and Oxygen. But in reality, Peacock is trying to be something closer to Hulu — a service for folks who like the kinds of shows on broadcast and cable networks, and don’t mind putting up with advertising if it means paying a lot less. So in addition to stuff borrowed from the various Comcast content libraries, you can watch back episodes of Paramount Network’s megahit Yellowstone, old episodes of George Lopez, Everybody Hates Chris, and The King of Queens, plus a decent (and ever-changing) selection of blockbuster movies. There are also Peacock originals, including an update of Brave New World and a thriller called Departure. You can even pretend you’re watching old school linear TV with Peacock’s Channels option, which lets users scroll through an on-screen program guide and join various programs already in progress.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckfiq0nmt000k3h78jc0bu6lk@published data-word-count=52><strong>Cost: </strong>A basic version is <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>free to anyone</a>, but doesn’t let you watch all Peacock originals and some big library titles.
